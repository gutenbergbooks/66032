<p>The usual schedules were sent to all the stations, except Tay
Light-ship and Carr Rock. Twelve stations on the East Coast of
Scotland have returned thirty-six schedules. Pentland Skerries
gives the heaviest returns with nine schedules. Isle of May
follows with eight schedules; and N. Unst is next in importance.
Then Bell Rock with two, and Fidra with three, run it
very close. We would like returns from Carr Rock and Tay
Light-ship next season, and will forward schedules, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We follow the same plan as in previous reports. The present
year's returns are indicated by asterisks.</p>

<p>The migration values of the various stations of the Scottish
Coasts are explained in the Report for 1884, p. 10, and need not
be repeated here.</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>Diary from the Stations.</i></p>

<p><i>N. Unst.</i>&mdash;John Nichol (principal) sends in seven well-filled
schedules. Mr Nichol has the following notes: "March,
25th.&mdash;I am told the Black Crows were not seen in former
years. Although a severe winter time, birds are much
earlier seen, also of various kinds. August.&mdash;Stormy Petrels
do not breed on this rock, but do so among the rocks on shore.
Puffins, Razorbills, Tysties, Kittiwakes, and a few Gulls, also
one pair of Seapies breed on the rock. Puffins are fewer in
number this year than in former times. September.&mdash;Much
greater movements in September 1886 than has been in former
years. I am told that on an island four miles to the west of us
Pictarnies breed in great numbers. None ever come near us."
Mr J. N. sends one schedule devoted entirely to Solan Geese,
and adds the note: "We do not see greater numbers together
than twenty at a time, and down to one. General occupation
is fishing; but flocks on 11th, 13th, and 14th October were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span>
supposed to be migrating right away." Mr J. N. then adds:
"Since filling up this schedule (to date of 25th October), have
been told that on 29th October three large Swans rested on the
Loch of Cliff on their way south. November 5th.&mdash;One Eagle
shot near Holderswick measured across the wings seven feet.
A Woodpecker seen at Baltasound. When fish seem plentiful
about the rock, Common Gulls are in abundance; occasionally
Herring Gulls and Iceland Gulls, Black-backed Gulls, Common
Skua Gull, of which a few breed at Unst. On shore at the Loch
of Cliff, throughout the autumn, a Herring Bird, some Plovers,
Curlews, Snipes, and Wild Ducks. A few of the latter breed at
the Loch of Cliff. At Lerwick, on 10th October, two large
flocks of Swans passed over the town, flying in a southerly
direction; and one flew very low while near the town. Up to
the date of 30th October 1886, no Wren has been seen; should
I get one, shall not fail to send it on. One seen on 2 2d November;
could not be caught." At date of December 20th, Mr J.
N. writes: "All birds have now deserted us. None seen since
the 1st December, except in favourable weather, such as are
mentioned in the schedule for December 1885, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;Starlings,
Sparrow Hawks, Crows, and Gulls. We had no great rushes of
birds in the night time this year like last year; but a greater
number seen in the day time. On November 18th sixty Bottle-nosed
Whales, the largest about twenty-two feet long, were
captured at Cullivoe, Unst. Five boats (manned) put off and
gave chase. Boats having got to seaward, they were turned for
the shore, and were getting well in, when they suddenly turned
about and put to sea again. Boats, after a hard struggle, again
got the off-side of them, and slowly commenced to shorten the
distance between them and the shore. Not until 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, after
six hours' chase, were the boats successful in reaching the
'school.' After the monsters were stranded the scene was very
animated, as they lashed the water to foam with their tails in
their frantic efforts to get away again. It was not till late at
night that killing operations were accomplished. On 24th
November sixty whales were exposed for sale, and realised a
sum of £119. The number of buyers was limited, but the competition
was keen." On January 11, 1887, Mr J. N., in a letter,
records the occurrence of one Snowy Owl seen on the summit
of Hermann's Hill; and an Eagle, flying high over, came down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
and gave the shepherd's dogs chase, but sheered off when it saw
the shepherd.</p>

<p><i>Sumburgh Head.</i>&mdash;Sends one schedule, but adds: "Birds are
very scarce here." Sent me a specimen of a rare bird, which
I knew at once to be a specimen of <i>Phylloscopus superciliosus</i>,
and which has already been recorded [<i>Proceedings Royal Physical
Society, Edinburgh</i>, vol. for 1885-86, p. 298], and was exhibited
at a meeting of that Society. Writing in reply to
inquiries of mine, under 16th October, to Mr Youngclause, he
writes: "I was after a small bird to-day about the dykes, very
similar, but it got away."</p>

<p><i>North Ronaldshay.</i>&mdash;John Tulloch. One well-filled schedule,
ranging from March 18 to September 15.</p>

<p><i>Pentland Skerries.</i>&mdash;John Gilmour (principal) sends nine
heavily-filled schedules. In a letter of 1st October, Mr Gilmour
speaks of great numbers of Twites on the island. "Of
course they breed here; but I think their numbers have been
increased of late, as there is a great flock of them." Later
he adds: "I may mention that the Rock Pipit is resident
here; and also the Lark, Starling, and Rock Dove are scarcely
ever absent from the station." A little earlier&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, 29th September&mdash;Mr
G. writes: "The autumn migration is not yet quite
commenced, although there have been a few birds seen; but
should the wind work round to the east we will likely have a
rush. I send you the names of all the birds that bred here this
season (1886), <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;Stormy Petrel, Puffin, Tern [two species,&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.], Black Guillemot, Oyster-Catcher, Eider Duck,
Ringed Plover, Dunlin, Lapwing, Corncrake, Rock Dove, Starling,
Lark, Twite, Wheatear, and Rock Pipit. The above are
the only species which breed regularly here. The Herring Gull
and Grey Crow build some seasons, but not this year. I have
heard it said the Snipe breeds also, but I have never seen the nest
during the last five years&mdash;the time I have been at this station.</p>

<p>"I take little notice of Solans in the schedules, as I may say
they have been going past all season in all weathers, and I still
see some going east yet (29th September)." (See also under
Mull of Galloway, West Coast, visited by Mr G. on his holiday,
16th August to 6th September.) A day-to-day return of Gannets
or Solan Geese desired, and a separate schedule devoted
to the species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span></p>

<p>Writing again on 21st October, Mr G. says: "I again beg
to send you two schedules. Since the 4th we have had a great
rush of migrants. The prevailing wind being from the east, as
soon as it shifted round to the west birds began to leave; but
were back again as soon as the wind shifted to east. I send
you wings and feet for identification, and will be much obliged
by an early reply if I have named the species correctly."<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Later he has the note: "Solans ceased going east about the end
of September; only a straggler seen now and again during this
month (October)." Besides the above, Mr Gilmour has many
interesting notes, which, however, come to be more easily worked
from the schedules into the text under species.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Correctly named:&mdash;Blackcap and Great Spotted Woodpecker [Recorded <i>Proc.
Roy. Phys. Soc. Edinb.</i>, vol. for 1885-86, pp. 298, 299.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]. Also immature
Pied Flycatcher, 7th October.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dunnet Head.</i>&mdash;David Laidlaw (principal) sends one schedule,
in which are the following notes: "On the 23d May a swallow
entered Dunnet Established Church during the forenoon service
(one of the doors being open), and after flying through the
church for about half an hour, made its exit by the same door
that it entered by. S.E., fresh breeze, clear." Under date of
January 15, 1887, he writes: "For the last month I see a good
many Song Thrushes about the fields daily. Starlings and
Linnets are to be seen here in large flocks all the year round.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
No birds struck or lighted on the lantern during the year except
the Wren mentioned in schedule. As to sea-birds, the
Gulls<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> came to breed about the 1st of March, and left about
the latter end of September. The other birds arrived about
six weeks later, and took their departure about a month earlier
than the Gulls. During the latter end of July, and the months
of August and September, almost every minute of the day,
Solan Geese pass and re-pass in flocks of two or three up to
twenty or thereby." [A day-to-day return of numbers in a
schedule devoted to the species might prove valuable to our
Committee.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> These are probably true Rose-Linnets, which abound in the north of Caithness.
The Twite is comparatively rare, at least in summer.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Herring Gulls breed in astonishing numbers all round the coast from Dwarwick
Head.&mdash;J. A. H.-B. Lesser B. B. Gull is rare.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Noss Head.</i>&mdash;James Ferrier sends a schedule, with the
note: "Sorry I cannot give you as full a return (but I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
given you all that we have taken note of) as I could have done
from the Little Ross, having been transferred from there in
February last. Several species of birds lay in the rocks about
this headland, such as the Common Gull [? Herring Gull.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.],
Cormorant, Tystie, Guillemot, Razorbill. The
Gulls are very tame here, often sitting on the tops of the houses
throughout the town (Wick), drawn there by the great quantity
of fish caught, and hanging about the houses." We are
very glad to get our first return from Noss Head, however light,
and we hope Mr Ferrier will continue to assist us.&mdash;(See last
Report, 1885, p. 15.)</p>

<p><i>Cromarty Lighthouse.</i>&mdash;Robt. S. Ritson sends one schedule,
January 1886 to December 27, mostly referring to local migrations
of Ducks, Geese, Gulls, which have always special interest
also attaching to them.</p>

<p><i>Girdleness.</i>&mdash;C. C. Irvine sends one schedule, the first received
from this station. He adds: "Very few birds come this way;
but Rooks, Sparrows, and Gulls are to be seen almost every
day; but as they are not migratory, I presume they are not
worthy of notice, and our time being much occupied during the
day, many may pass without our observing them."</p>

<p><i>Bell Rock.</i>&mdash;James Jack sends two carefully written schedules
as usual, strictly adhering to the headings, which always makes
the work of posting the items into the ledger easier for the Committee.
Mr Jack, after an illness on shore between 23d October
and 11th November, writes, on resuming duty: "As yet, Redwings
have been the most prolific in numbers visiting this station
this season; in fact, night after night, nothing else. All our
usual winter feathered companions are now again thickly around
us. Dunters are very abundant this season."</p>

<p>This remarkable immigration of Redwings is scarcely noted
at any other stations; at least, with regard to its exclusiveness.</p>

<p><i>Isle of May.</i>&mdash;Joseph Agnew sends eight schedules filled with
his usual care, and dating February 3 to November 6, 1886, and
kept up till his removal by the authorities to the Monach Isles,
off the Outer Hebrides, the electric lighting of the Isle of May
being completed, and an electric engineer placed in charge.
Under date of April 6, 1886, Mr Agnew writes: "I send you
the Turtle Dove. It had been very severely shot before it
came here by some one. I did not send it to Small, but made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
the best of it myself, covering the wounds as well as I could."
Under date of October 12, 1886, Mr Agnew writes: "The old
carboy is still doing duty yet, and has been emptied two or
three times. On one occasion it contained a <i>cosmic mouse</i>, but
whether it came from Jupiter or Mars, or some other far off
world, I do not know." As this carboy was put <i>in situ</i> by ourselves
in October 1884, in behalf of the Marine Station at
Granton, we would be interested to know whether it has yielded
any scientific results. Perhaps Mr John Murray will enlighten
us. Regarding the electric light, Mr Agnew writes: "It will
be ready in a few weeks, perhaps three weeks. I do not know
what effect it will have on the birds. The light will be very
intense, and the most powerful light in existence. The room
in which the trials are now being conducted has the appearance
of a place brilliantly lighted up at night, though it is in the
day time. The daylight is made to disappear. If the light
were a fixed one, same as the old one, I think it might have a
<i>good</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> effect, but I am afraid its quick revolving character will
be against it. The light has been revolving for the last two
months with the oil lamp, and though some birds have come to
the lantern, I don't think, considering the numbers of birds, so
many have struck as heretofore. But as I am leaving this, I
very much fear the reports will be very meagre in future, if
there be any at all. The man who succeeds me has been here
for a month or more, and he seems to have no notion of the
matter, and has never interested himself in it; and besides, he
will be very little in the light-room; his principal business
will be in the engine-house, though he is to be head-keeper.
You may perhaps be able to get him interested in it. The two
men, however, whose special duty will be in the light-room,
may take up the subject, and do something; but I would
say&mdash;be very thankful for what you have already got from
Isle of May." In a later letter (26th October), Mr Agnew
says: "I am now almost convinced that few birds will come
near the lantern, the revolutions are so quick, <i>viz.</i>, eight flashes
in the minute. We can see the birds going round with the
rays, and though they make a dash at the lantern, before they
reach it the light leaves them, and they turn round after it
again, and repeat the same. During all last week there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
one Redstart, one Starling, and one Robin at the lantern; not a
Woodcock has struck this year; the Goldcrests which used to
flock about the lantern never come near it; <i>though they are very
numerous on the island</i>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I have only seen two at the lantern.
A fixed white light is no doubt best for attracting birds; the
alternate light and darkness baffles them altogether, and the
quicker the revolutions are, the worse baffled they become.
There has been almost total absence during the past two years
of Redpoles and Siskins." On the 19th November Mr Agnew
writes: "James" (his son) "shot a Great Spotted Woodpecker
on the 12th of this month. It is the first of its kind I have
seen here. It came after the great N.-E. gale reported in my
last schedule. The wind continued to blow strong from the
N.-E. for days after the gale took off. I have sent it to Small
to get stuffed and set up. I want to give it in a present to the
young lady to whom my son, Joseph, is going to be married at
Dunbar." Mr Agnew then continues: "There has not been
much worth reporting since I sent you my last schedule (Nov.
6, 1886); the only birds (not resident) were some Wagtails and
Common Wrens. I suspect very much you have got the last
schedule from Isle of May. I am sorry for that, as you see
from the Woodpecker that strange things are always turning
up. I am very sorry at leaving the collection here, and I doubt
if it will be so well taken care of when I am away."</p>

<p>We have given Mr Agnew's correspondence very fully, as it
is the last we shall get from him at the Isle of May, and it
would be very ungracious if we did not take this opportunity
of once again expressing our warmest thanks for his able assistance
and always interesting correspondence. Comparisons are
said to be invidious, but we are quite sure none of his fellow-keepers
will grudge him the fullest praise which our Migration
Committee can accord. Mr Cordeaux says (16th Oct.
1886): "I am much concerned that Agnew is leaving the
Isle of May." We do not undervalue the observations of any
of our reporters, many of whom have not the opportunities of
observation which others have; but we can point to a good
many more of the lighthouse keepers, both at the best stations
and at the least frequented, who, according to their
opportunities, are not far behind Mr Agnew, if at all; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
there is ever increasing interest and ability displayed year by
year.</p>

<p><i>Fidra.</i>&mdash;Mr Win. Ross has taken up the subject earnestly,
and sends us three excellent schedules, carefully adhering to
the columnar arrangement, which is so important to the Members
of Committee, who have to transcribe into the ledger,
and then write its Report. Attention to this is of infinite service
and saving of time in getting the Reports printed. We
are much obliged to Mr Ross for the care taken in this respect.</p>

<p>Under date of 4th September, Mr W. Ross writes: "I have to
acknowledge receipt of your printed circular, concerning envelopes
to contain wings of unknown birds, to be forwarded to
you for identification, and labels for marking the same." ....
"After Sunday, my last schedule, I continued making jottings,
and the 24th of March, from 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to daylight, was really
interesting. The flocks of birds about the lantern were immense,
and so numerous, that in striking the glass they broke the outside
glass protector of our thermometer. There has not been
anything unusual since that date." [Fidra promises well to be
an important observatory, under certain conditions of wind and
weather.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>Later, under date of 18th September 1886, Mr W. Ross says:
"Had I known Moths would have been of any use to you, I believe
I could have given you a varied, rare, and enormous parcel. Last
month it was Moths everywhere, after darkness set in. I had
to sweep them down with a towel, some very large and beautiful.
Mr Anderson (of Messrs A. &amp; F., Edinr., Advocates?)
seems a keen entomologist, and I was describing some of these
to him (on the occasion of a visit he paid to Fidra on the 6th
September). One beautiful specimen&mdash;not a moth, I think&mdash;of
a size between a daddy-long-legs and dragon-fly, and much
the same shape; enormous bronze wings, beautiful vermilion
body, black head, with a red (or yellow?) streak (or spot?), and
antennas more like a young lobster than anything else.</p>

<p>"Eider Ducks, I understand, used to breed on all the islands
about here. But this year a man got a dozen small boats, and
hired them out at N. Berwick; the consequence is that the
Ducks have entirely left the Craig and Lamb Islands owing to
their nests having been plundered. We on Fidra consequently
have had a greater number of birds breeding, and found many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
nests with 6 to 8 eggs; also Terns, and many smaller birds. As
we are strictly prohibited from using a gun on this precious
island, I can't send you many specimens; but if anything does
turn up, I will not fail to send it you."</p>

<p>Later, under date of 1st October, in reply to inquiries, Mr
W. Ross writes: "It was the latter half of August that these
Moths were so numerous; and though in September there were
a few, it was nothing in comparison with the multitudes that
occurred the previous month. Some guide such as you suggest"
[referring to Johns' "Book of Birds"], "to enable observers to
recognise species, would be of immense advantage. I am woefully
deficient in this respect, and I am persuaded others are
equally so. I hope your Committee will succeed in supplying
some reliable book to render assistance in this respect."</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdidæ.</span>&mdash;Thrushes.&mdash;In February the only returns are from
Bell Rock and Isle of May, between the 3d and 20th; earliest
at Isle of May on 3d, one Missel Thrush; N.E., light clear.
Other species mentioned are Blackbirds, Redwings (along with
Larks and Starlings), at Bell Rock, with S.W. fresh breeze.
Great many struck and killed. Two female blackbirds at Isle
of May on 15th, and possibly remaining to breed. Mavises on
20th at Isle of May, and some Fieldfares; showers of snow.</p>

<p>In March no great movement, and a few records from Pentland
Skerries of single or small numbers of Blackbirds, and one
Thrush on 10th and 23d. Solitary Redwing on 23d at Isle of
May; and numbers of Thrushes at Fidra (XXVIII. B.), flying
about all night.</p>

<p><i>Spring.</i>&mdash;In April scattered birds only up to end of the
month at Isle of May of Fieldfares, one Redwing (23d), one
Ring Ouzel (21st); but on 19th, at Pentland Skerries, is entered
the record (which seems one of some importance): "Ring Ouzels
and Song Thrushes a great rush; strong S.E. and haze." And
on 26th: "A flock of Fieldfares (mod. S.E., haze), birds which
are seldom seen here in spring." Also on the 19th at North
Ronaldshay, a station not usually sending large spring returns:
"A great number of Thrushes were on the island. Stopped two
days;" wind S.E., haze. In May, at Isle of May, one record
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
only of a Fieldfare at the light on the 5th. No more till
autumn.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Earliest record of Blackbird at Pentland Skerries
on 9th August. Single records at Isle of May of Common
Mavis "migrating" on 19th, and of a Missel Thrush on 30th;
W.S.W., clear. <i>Latest</i> record, Fieldfares on 20th to 28th
November, "a good many;" at Dunnet Head, "seen all day;"
and scattered records through November at Pentland Skerries
of Thrush and Blackbird. In September also, quite scattered
records of single or very small lots of Blackbirds, Ring Ouzels,
Fieldfares, and Mavises, from Pentland Skerries, Isle of May,
and Fidra. But in October masses and rushes innumerable from
the following stations:&mdash;Pentland Skerries (Redwings, 4th to
16th). Isle of May (Blackbirds, mostly females, 7th; Fieldfares,
"numbers" on 18th, N.E. gale; Blackbirds, all males, on
21st, wind from E. to S.W.; Redwings, rush on 28th, S.E., fresh;
also of Fieldfares and Ring Ouzels and Blackbirds). Again, at
Pentland Skerries, great numbers of <i>Turdidæ</i> on 29th, of all
kinds. Greatest rush at Pentland Skerries of Redwings and
Song Thrushes (along with Goldcrests and Chaffinches, Robins,
a few Ring Ouzels, and Woodcock); strong S.E. gale and rain.
At Bell Rock, Redwings (without other species in any numbers),
22d to 26th October every night in numbers; wind from light W.
to E. and N.E. All through October indications, more or less
pronounced, at the following stations:&mdash;N. Unst, Sumburgh
Head, Pentland Skerries, Noss Head, Bell Rock, Isle of May,
Fidra.</p>

<p>From the above notes the migration of <i>Turdidæ</i> appears to
have been unusually compressed and sudden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolinæ.</span>&mdash;Chats.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;In March earliest two
Redstarts ("the first seen here") at N. Unst; S.E. and fog.
Wheatears at Isle of May on 24th and 26th, but only straggling
birds. In April, solitary record on 1st at Pentland Skerries.
Two on 27th at Bell Rock, and same date at Isle of May; and
Redstarts ("mostly males") intermittent all April. In May,
at Isle of May, Redstarts ("mostly females") on 3d, and intermittent
up to 19th; also Wheatears, Whinchats (numbers on
the 8th, and rush or great numbers on the 18th all day);
W.S.W., strong. In June a single solitary record of a Stonechat
(? Wheatear) from N. Unst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span></p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Few records in August; but on 31st numbers of
Wheatears at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> at the lantern. Latest records of <i>Saxicolinæ</i>,
24th October at Pentland Skerries; and next last there
also on the 22d, of Redstarts, both females; and on 26th of a
Stonechat at N. Unst (? Wheatear). At Isle of May on 5th,
and at Fidra, "numbers all day" on the island, of "Stonechats"
(<i>vera</i> at Isle of May? Wheatears? at Fidra). A not very
great or decided rush in September, principally noticeable at
Isle of May and Fidra, of "Stonechats."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviinæ.</span>&mdash;Robins, Whitethroats.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;A great rush
of Robins, with fresh S.E. haze, at Pentland Skerries, on 19th
April. "Good numbers" at Isle of May, on 23d; also Whitethroats
remained all night at Isle of May, on 28th April. A
rush took place of the latter at same station on May 3d;
"swarming" and culminating on 18th (one Willow Wren&mdash;<i>Phylloscopus</i>&mdash;appearing
with others on 19th). No Robins are;
noted in May anywhere.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;A solitary Robin on 24th August at Cromarty
(very likely a local resident). A few odd birds in September.
One Whitethroat and three Robins, all on different dates, at Isle
of May and Fidra; the Whitethroat on the 1st at Isle of May.
Rushes all in October, and returns sent from the following stations,
all of Robins:&mdash;N. Unst (1 Robin); Sumburgh Head, 1;
Pentland Skerries, Isle of May, and Fidra. Rushes mostly at
Isle of May and Fidra about 24th to 29th, and winds prevailing
easterly and south-easterly. No records in November. A solitary
record in December of two Robins at N. Unst, and one on
7th January 1887 at Dunnet Head. Migration of Robins
scarcely discernible in spring; and short, sharp, and decisive in
October. Of Whitethroats large. Local, <i>viz.</i>&mdash;at Isle of May; indicated
at N. Unst in spring; and only one record in September
at Isle of May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopinæ.</span>&mdash;Goldcrest (or Gold-crested Wren), Chiffchaff,
Willow Wren, Wood Warbler.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;At Fidra
numbers of Goldcrests flying about on 24th March; wind S.W.,
light breeze. The only other spring record of this species is on
the 27th March at Pentland Skerries&mdash;a single bird; mod. W.,
clear. This appears to have been a sudden departure, probably
general, but not coming much under notice. Of the same
species we have not another spring record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">- 13 -</span></p>

<p>Of Chiffchaff.&mdash;[The difficulty of determining Chiffchaffs and
Willow Wrens at any time, but more especially in autumn, even
to an expert, must in great measure militate against almost any
records of "Chiffchaff" at Isle of May. Yet there can be no
doubt that it has occurred there, certainly in October 1884;
and on one or two more occasions certain. There are many
records of "Chiffchaff" at Isle of May; but it is impossible to
say which are correct identifications, and which are really immature
Willow Warblers. That the Chiffchaff does occur is undoubted,
but to what extent is yet uncertain. Henceforth,
until certainty can be arrived at, we will only mention Chiffchaffs
in inverted commas.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>"Chiffchaff"&mdash;a single record at Isle of May on 12th April,
and Willow Wren very numerous on 19th May. One "Chiffchaff"
also noted on 5th May.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Goldcrests numerous on October 24th at Isle
of May; and numbers at Pentland Skerries, from 17th to 27th,
all day long. Seems to have been pretty general, as it is spoken
of at Noss Head, also on 24th; at Inchkeith, in small numbers,
7th, 8th, and 9th (light E. breezes). Numbers all day on Fidra
on 8th October, and also at Sumburgh Head on 7th and on
20th, and at Girdleness on the 21st. Numerous at Isle of May
up to 30th.</p>

<p>"Chiffchaff"&mdash;a solitary record of one at Isle of May on 27th
August. A great number (rush) of Willow Warblers at Isle of
May on 1st September&mdash;light W., fog&mdash;along with Sedge
Warblers. "Chiffchaff" is also recorded from North Unst by
Mr Charles Youngclause&mdash;light N.E., haze&mdash;a single bird.
Numbers again of "Chiffchaffs" at Isle of May on 19th. Those
who have their doubts about the occurrence in any number of
the Chiffchaff (<i>vera</i>) can read the above together with the
entries of <i>Willow Warbler</i>.</p>

<p>The migration of <i>Phylloscopinæ</i> is thus compressed into October,
with one rush in September of Willow Warblers, which
appears to have been preceded by one example of "Chiffchaff"
four days before. In preceding spring very pronounced on 18th
and 19th May at same station, Isle of May, of Willow Warblers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accentorinæ.</span>&mdash;Hedge Sparrows.&mdash;<i>Spring.</i>&mdash;Only two records
on 12th April at Isle of May (resident all winter); and at
Pentland Skerries on 19th, two&mdash;S.E., haze; and on 18th May,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span>
at Isle of May, a brood of young "now flying." <i>In Autumn</i>&mdash;only
record at Pentland Skerries, one seen all day&mdash;light S.W.;
"seldom seen here."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalinæ.</span>&mdash;Sedge Warbler.&mdash;No spring notice. In
Autumn&mdash;only two in August at Isle of May. Sedge Warbler,
one, on 20th&mdash;calm, clear; and on 23d, two&mdash;light S.E. wind;
but large numbers (in company with Willow Warbler rush) at
Isle of May on 2d September. The Willow Warbler rush came
on the 1st, the Sedge Warblers on the 2d; the former at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
of that day&mdash;light W., fog; the latter at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> of the next
day&mdash;light W., and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytidæ.</span>&mdash;Wren.&mdash;Nests on Fidra. No spring records.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;At Dunnet Head two&mdash;strong W. breeze&mdash;"young
birds," on 31st August. And at Inchkeith, Firth of
Forth, one caught on lantern, wind light south. [The above
are the only records in August,&mdash;what connection appears again
between N. of Caithness and Firth of Forth?&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
No more movements on record till October. "Great numbers"
at Isle of May on 21st and 24th. No other records, except at
Pentland Skerries&mdash;a single bird on the 28th. Latest record,
one bird at N. Unst on 22d November.</p>

<p>The above notes tend to accentuate, along with many other
parallelisms, what we already consider the chief routes across
Scotland (see last Report, p. 23).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillidæ.</span>&mdash;Wagtails.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;Earliest record is on
24th March of Wagtails at Isle of May, two seen&mdash;light to fresh
S.E., and haze. A few scattered records in April, on 13th and
19th, at Pentland Skerries. One record at N. Ronaldshay on 6th
May, and one on 20th at Pentland Skerries. Nests found on
Fidra, 15th June. Whereas in 1885 Report Wagtails were recorded
in every month except July, this season we find all the
following blank of records:&mdash;February, March, April, July,
November, and December (see Autumn).</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Records bulk largest in September, both in
number of records (6) and bulk of numbers (rush of old and
young on 3d and again on 15th at Isle of May, and a few from
8th to 11th at Pentland Skerries, and a few from 8th to 9th
resting all day at N. Unst). Again in October, a few (5) records
of smaller numbers, 3d to 24th, at N. Ronaldshay, Pentland
Skerries, and Isle of May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillidæ.</span>&mdash;<i>Anthinæ.</i>&mdash;Pipits, OR "Mosscheepers," "Titlarks."&mdash;<i>In
Spring.</i>&mdash;Earliest record at N. Unst, 7th March, of
"Mosscheepers," N.W., fresh, and again one on 21st. On 20th
and 23d March, Meadow Pipits, a few at Isle of May, calm,
clear, and S.E., fresh haze. A few again at N. Unst on 23d,
"Mosscheepers." No records in May or June. <i>In July</i>&mdash;young
"Mosscheepers" seen for first time on 6th. In August,
on the 27th, accessions to the numbers breeding on Isle of May,
probably the young hatched off and on wing. In September,
accessions of both Rock Pipits and Meadow Pipits by 15th, at
Bell Rock, and Rock Pipits numerous on Isle of May on 20th.
Numerous to 29th October. No other records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscicapidæ.</span>&mdash;Flycatchers.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;On 21st and 22d
March Spotted Flycatchers, single records at N. Unst. In
April, the only record is on 19th at Pentland Skerries, when
"a rush" is recorded. Fresh S.E., haze (Pied Flycatchers),
and on 21st May one ditto all day there.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Only one record in all of a single Spotted Flycatcher
on Fidra, on 7th. Light S.E., fog.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;From 23d to 31st August a considerable movement
(40 seen) at Isle of May on 30th; and on 2d September,
"Swallows departed" at Pentland Skerries. 1 Swallow seen
at N. Unst on 23d August, and 6 Martins flying about top of
cliffs for six days previous to 30th August at Dunnet Head.
A rush again at Isle of May on 27th, 28th, and 29th September,
especially on latter two dates. Wind S.E. on 29th, shifted
from W. Gale and clear day before. No later records.</p>

and December; few at N. Unst; flocks at Pentland Skerries
on four dates of 4th to 17th, and a good number at Isle of May
on 6th. Flocks at Isle of May in December, and a few at
Sumburgh Head and Pentland Skerries. Yellow Hammer only
once mentioned at Isle of May on 10th February&mdash;a single bird.
Common Bunting, single birds, on 8th, 15th, and 27th March,
at Pentland Skerries; once in April at same station; once in
July ditto; very few records in September, same station; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span>
in October, same station. None later, nor at any other station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudidæ.</span>&mdash;Larks.&mdash;Larks are entered under every month
in the year except July and August. They are least abundant
in April, May, and June&mdash;of these months in which they do
occur in Spring,&mdash;and in November and December. Numbers
and rushes in September and October in Autumn, and in January
1887. (Probably local movements.) Large numbers in
Spring 1886, on 15th February.</p>

<p><i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;They visited Isle of May, and stayed for some
weeks in February. Other slight records occur at Pentland
Skerries and Bell Rock same month. Considerable movements
also all March at Isle of May and Fidra.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Greatest numbers in September, on 25th to
29th, at Sumburgh Head; and on 27th and 29th at Isle of May.
Strong W. and S.W. winds. A very heavy and very general
rush is recorded during October from each and all of the following
stations:&mdash;Pentland Skerries, 16th; Isle of May, 18th to
28th, culminating at latter date, preceded by "great numbers"
and "large numbers" on preceding dates; at Inchkeith (9th,
"flocks of") and at Fidra; 5th to 6th, and 14th to 17th, "numbers"
and "flocks all day." ["Wood Larks" are also mentioned by
name, but probably Pipits?&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] "Great flocks" again
at Isle of May on 22d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturninæ.</span>&mdash;Starlings.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;Absent from N. Unst
between 1st and 18th February. Returned to the rock again
on 26th. Visit Isle of May for some weeks in February, and
remain in still larger numbers till late in March, but decreasing
again in April. Preparing to breed at Fidra by 16th April.
Breeds also at Isle of May, but cannot quite be looked upon as
a resident there. Nests found on Fidra in June. Flocks of
young every day at Isle of May in August. Rush did not take
place till 5th at Fidra, 28th at Isle of May. Seemed to be
collecting for some time previous to great rush on 28th. First
autumn movement noticed at N. Unst was not till 10th to
12th November; then seen daily. Last record at Fidra on 25th
November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvidæ.</span>&mdash;Rooks, Ravens, Crows, Hooded Crows, Jackdaws,
Choughs (or "Red-legged Crows").&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;Hooded Crows
and Ravens occasionally seen at N. Unst&mdash;resident? Also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span>
Raven occasionally seen there in March, April, September,
October, and November, always one, two, three, or four, and
therefore probably birds breeding, or reared on N. Unst main-island.
In the same way Ravens occasionally seen at N.
Ronaldshay, Pentland Skerries, etc., can only be looked upon
as "on predatory quest intent."</p>

<p>"Black Crows" at N. Unst are probably Rooks, usually
"flying south" (if they come from E. turning south no doubt at
Unst). We would like to feel sure if these Black Crows are
Carrion Crows or Rooks; but "Rooks" by name are never
mentioned at N. Unst. Indeed, "Rooks" by name are only
mentioned by reporters from Pentland Skerries and Fidra, but
"Black Crows" and "Crows" seem to have general application
even at Isle of May. We would like Rooks distinguished from
Carrion Crows <i>or</i> Corbie Crows. The terms "Crows" and
"Black Crows" might mean either the Carrion Crow or the
Rook. [Those who have Johns' book will easily see the
difference.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] Considerable movements all through
the year, extending from N. Unst southwards, of Hooded Crows
and "Black Crows" and Rooks. Jackdaws visited Isle of May
in a fog in April, and stayed all night of the 11th; and two had
previously been seen on March 19th. Noticed also occasionally
at Fidra. Heaviest appearances of <i>Corvidæ</i> in October when
migration was almost continuously heavy; lightest, however, at
N. Unst; heaviest at Pentland Skerries 5th to 11th October.
Continuous but much lighter returns from N. Unst, N. Ronaldshay,
Pentland Skerries, and Fidra, in September, and curiously,
none from Isle of May. Light returns again from N. Unst and
Fidra in November, and only two from Pentland Skerries in
December.</p>

<p>The uniformity of time in rushes of almost all species is
singular this season, October being the favoured month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselidæ.</span>&mdash;Swifts.&mdash;["Swallow Swift" of Isle of May returns.]&mdash;In
spring or summer three "Swallow Swifts" at Isle
of May, light, W., clear. No other records, except one on 3d
May at same station.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Two Swifts at Pentland Skerries catching
insects round the tower; light, S.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculidæ.</span>&mdash;Cuckoo.&mdash;Only one notice at Isle of May on
18th May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picidæ.</span>&mdash;Woodpeckers.&mdash;The Great Spotted Woodpeckers
appeared in considerable numbers this autumn along the eastern
counties of Scotland, in one or two cases reaching to the
west counties south of the Firth of Clyde. Almost all the
specimens examined by us and by Mr Evans of Edinburgh
proved to be either old birds or birds with very slight traces of
immaturity. The only ones appearing at lighthouses known to
us was one sent us from Pentland Skerries, and one obtained at
Isle of May. It occurred also, as we are informed by Mr E.
Service, in the Solway district. This flight occurred in October,
and I find the Pentland Skerries bird bears date of 14th.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Another is reported from N. Unst (see Diary from the Stations). Besides these,
we have records of the following, obligingly sent us by Mr Geo. Sim of Aberdeen;
and we obtained other records from Fife; also one from Dumfries, from Mr
Service of Maxwelltown, Dumfries. We had hoped also to have added all the
records of specimens examined by Mr Evans; but up to date of going to press,
these records have not come to hand. It would have been better to have them
all recorded in one place.</p>

<div class="ind2em">

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigidæ.</span>&mdash;Owls.&mdash;A very slight record, and entirely in
October. One "Large Grey Owl" at Pentland Skerries. "The
first seen for a long time; sat on the island." Three Short-Eared
Owls on 8th, 9th. and 19th respectively, at Isle of May,
and one Grey Owl again at Pentland Skerries on 29th. "Flew
across island."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconidæ.</span>&mdash;"Hawks," Falcons, Kestrels, Sparrow Hawk,
Merlin, Peregrine, etc.&mdash;Records scattered more or less through
the year as usual, but March, August, and December contain
none. October again has largest number. Species noted are
Peregrine ("or Falcon"), "Hawks," Kestrel (daily for a week at
N. Unst), Sparrow Hawk, Large Hawks (Bell Rock, 19th
October); "flying W.," etc.</p>

<p>Of Cormorants we have spring records in April at N. Unst,
daily fishing. Daily records at same place in September
between 1st and 9th, about four or five pairs. One pair breeds
regularly, and rears young at N. Unst (noted 11th July 1886).
Also at Fidra&mdash;six birds to twelve&mdash;from 6th to 29th (three
records).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span></p>

<p>We have no notes on the Green Cormorant or Shag or Crested
Cormorant from any stations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>To the
Reporters.</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanidæ.</span>&mdash;Solan Goose or Gannet, Cormorant, Shag,
Scart, etc.&mdash;This year we give a day-by-day return of Solan
Geese seen at N. Unst during September and October. We
would like to complete a year's observations of the movements
of this bird at the following stations:&mdash;N. Unst, Bell Rock,
Pentland Skerries, Cape Wrath, Butt of Lewis, Monach Isles,
Barra Head, and Ailsa Craig, and Turnberry on the coast of
Ayrshire. We would also like daily returns made at Skerryvore
or Dhuheartach [all negative evidence being carefully entered,
such as "none seen" on such and such a date or succession of
dates], and also at Rona, north of Raasay. A separate schedule
or more might be devoted to Gannet or Solan Goose alone for
every day in the year, noting carefully the direction of flight
of flocks or individuals, or how employed. If we had such a
series complete, we believe much light might be thrown upon
migrations of fish in combination with work going on at Lochbuie
in Mull, at the Marine Institute there.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg to inform you that since answering your note regarding Solan Geese when on shore
two Solan Geese were seen here on the 12th inst.; also one on the 19th flying about. A large flock
of Kittiwakes on 12th passed; direction from S.W. going N.E. This is a rare occurrence, for I
know not of any person having seen any of these two species so early in the year. Since writing on
27th twenty-four Solan Geese seen very busy fishing for about two hours. We have been thinking
herring must be close by us, this causing Solan Geese coming so soon this year. Can't vouch for
the truth of this, for we could not make out whether herrings or small fish.&mdash;J. N.</p>
</div>

<p>Of records of Solan Geese at other times and localities, as
usual, movements commenced towards the close of March (we
have one early record of three at Pentland Skerries on 5th,
flying east).</p>

<p>We do not enter into detail, as we would prefer to give a full
schedule from each station as indicated above. We add this
note here however; Latest seen at Fidra was on 20th, when the
note occurs "disappeared." On 14th October, "one young bird;
not another to be seen;" and on 10th October, "Solans visibly
scarcer," at Fidra.</p>

<p>Of Herons, a few scattered records; not of much service we
suspect to our Migration Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatidæ.</span>&mdash;Ducks, Geese, Eider Ducks, Teal, Widgeon, Shieldrake,
Wild Duck, Barnicle Geese, Swans, Brent Geese.&mdash;<i>In
Spring</i> flocks, or large flocks, of Barnicle Geese are frequently
noted at Cromarty, presumably the same flocks daily. (Barnicle
is here undoubtedly applied wrongly to the Brent Geese, or
"Brants," which are abundant in the Cromarty Firth.) Thus on
19th, 25th, and 26th February, and from 4th to 18th March, a
"large flock" is almost daily noted; and thereafter none are
again noted till November 24, when a flock again recorded, and
two flocks on 25th and 27th December, all at the same place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span></p>

<p><i>Eider Duck.</i>&mdash;Odd birds noted off N. Unst in February 5th
and 18th, and March 23d and 26th&mdash;winds different directions;
and a flock of nine at Isle of May on 18th April. Odd records
in May and June at N. Ronaldshay and at Fidra, probably
merely local movements. <i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Recorded as "making
their appearance by the 5th September at N. Ronaldshay; and
large flocks by the 11th September at Pentland Skerries.
Flocks all day on several dates in October at N. Unst, and
Fidra, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Teal are noted occasionally at Pentland Skerries in March on
1st and 2d. <i>Widgeon</i> rarely noted: once in March at Isle of
May, and once in October at Fidra. <i>Shieldrake</i> once noted at
Noss Head, and once on 15th November on Fidra.</p>

<p>Wild Swans are noted on 12th April, and four on 25th at
N. Ronaldshay; and thirty on one occasion at Sumburgh Head.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;A most remarkable assemblage of Eider Ducks took
place off the west shore of Harris, as seen and reported to me
by James Cowan, Esq., M.P. He writes, under date of 18th
March 1887: "Last year, owing to the easterly winds, we had
not less than 3000 Eiders within four miles of our cottage, on
the west coast of Harris; and the year before there was not
one."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbidæ.</span>&mdash;Pigeons, Doves.&mdash;Rock Dove, Wood Pigeon,
Turtle Dove.&mdash;A Turtle Dove was obtained at Isle of May on
31st May 1886; wind light S.E., and haze. An addition to the
Isle of May list and collection; at present at Dunipace House.</p>

<p>A single record of a Wood Pigeon, "seldom seen here," at
Pentland Skerries on 18th June; and another at same place on
7th October, "flying west; rare "&mdash;fresh, variable, and haze.</p>

<p>A single record of Rock Pigeons (a flock) on 20th at Pentland
Skerries, and the remark, "seldom seen." There were
twenty in the flock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallidæ.</span>&mdash;Corncrake, Water Rail, etc.&mdash;Heard first time at
Pentland Skerries on 19th May, and at Cromarty on 25th.
Above are the only records of any of the Rails.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriadæ.</span>&mdash;Plover, Golden Plover, Lapwing, Dotterel,
Ringed Dotterel or Ringed Plover, Oyster-Catcher or Sea Pie,
Grey Plover, Golden Plover.&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;Movements scarce;
in February (one record on 25th at Pentland Skerries); in
March (one record at same).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span></p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;No great movements recorded. First seen at
N. Ronaldshay August 25; spoken of as "arrived." Very few
records in September, October, or November. Slight increase
in December at Pentland Skerries only. Of Oyster-Catchers or
Sea Pies rather more frequent returns, but bulking only in
September and October. <i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;Lapwings noted considerably
in March at many stations from N. Unst, Pentland
Skerries, Bell Rock, Isle of May, and Fidra.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Slight movements only in September and
October. Ringed Dotterel <i>or</i> Ringed Plover&mdash;one in September at
Pentland Skerries, and one at same place all day on 3d December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacidæ.</span>&mdash;Woodcock, Snipe, Curlew, Jack Snipe.&mdash;Of
Woodcock no spring movement observed. No records of Woodcock
at all until October. First seen at Pentland Skerries;
two all day on 5th October; then one killed at light on 7th, and
a rush on 10th. Then also at N. Ronaldshay one bird seen on
6th; and at Girdleness, Aberdeen, and at Isle of May, from 6th
on till 28th, varying numbers&mdash;eight shot on 18th, four or five
on 20th; "numbers" seen on 24th&mdash;wind N.E., veering to
S.E.; haze at night. Some (two shot) on 28th. Latest record,
one Woodcock at Dunnet Head on 14th November, and two at
Pentland Skerries on 1st and 12th November. In Stirlingshire
thirty-five shot one day in Torwood, and twenty-eight in Touch
Woods. Unusually abundant this autumn. The Woodcocks
shot at Torwood on the 20th November came into the country
almost certainly at the time of the October rush, and remained
there and throughout Stirlingshire for several weeks, during
which time many were killed. On the West Coast a friend and
myself bagged 33½ couples in seven days' shooting. We had a
<i>blizzard</i> of snow and wind on Monday, January 17th. We left
on 21st; and we heard afterwards that not a Cock was to be
seen on and after the 24th January 1887.</p>

<p><i>Snipe.</i>&mdash;A few scattered spring records. No mention again
till September, and then decidedly very few all over. Decidedly
scarce this autumn. In the West of Scotland (Ardnamurchan),
where Woodcock were so plentiful, Snipe were unusually scarce.
Only four seen one day, where usually seven or eight couple can
be shot in an hour or two.</p>

<p>Records of Curlews few and far between; and none of any
special interest, being mostly local movements.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the comparative strength of the
waves are approximately given from each station, Pentland
Skerries leading with twenty-four, and Isle of May following
with eight, etc.; also, the totals under each month show the rush
to have been distinctly in October with fifteen,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> September and
December each with seven. This same system, carried out for
each species of bird, appears to us to suggest a pretty fair way
of reducing our light reports to system; and further tabular
comparison is also suggested as to duration of migration, and
weather notes in last report, p. 34, which need not be repeated
here at present.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> This is borne out almost with all species this season. A concentrated rush
in October.</p>

</div>

<p>Of Redshanks, Sandpipers, Dunlins, there are very few
returns; and only one Dunlin at Pentland Skerries, where they
breed, on 27th April. Redshanks appeared at N. Ronaldshay
on 12th August. Numbers towards end of September at Pentland
Skerries; a few in October, with a number of Purple
Sandpipers. A Common Sandpiper at N. Unst on 23d October.
Redshanks on 3d December at Pentland Skerries, and number
of Purple Sandpipers all day on 19th December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laridæ.</span>&mdash;Gulls, Terns, Skuas, etc., Kittiwake, Lesser Tern,
"Dirty Allen," Black Backed Gull.&mdash;The same remarks hold
good under Gulls of sorts. The spring and summer records are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">- 25 -</span>
not of special interest; but vast movements took place in September.
"Immense flocks" of Gulls; "numerous flocks" of
Kittiwakes and Gulls; Skuas and Terns "every day." Thirty-seven
large Gulls passed Girdleness flying south on 15th September;
but the "largest flock ever seen" at Fidra was on 14th.
Curiously enough there are <i>no records</i> made of movements at
Isle of May; but at Pentland Skerries, and again at Fidra, very
full notice is taken. No records in November. Only one in
December at Pentland Skerries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellariidæ.</span>&mdash;Petrels, Stormy Petrel.&mdash;The Stormy Petrels
often appear at lanterns at night in midsummer, but this is in
all probability merely a local movement. Being nocturnal in
their habits, and abroad only at night, certain lighthouses lure
them to their light more readily than others, owing to proximity
to breeding stations or lines of flight to and from their feeding
grounds. Their breeding season being very late in the year,
the months of August and September bulk largest, but movements
commence usually in June; July, however, is often less
marked as a month for their movements, except in exceptionably
hazy weather for that month.</p>

<p>This season records are not numerous; <i>but</i>, what we have not
recorded before, a rush of Stormy Petrels took place at N. Unst,
from the 23d to 28th August, "nightly"&mdash;winds variable and
overcast; striking lantern "continuously." When, perhaps, we
know all the exact minutiæ of the breeding distribution, and
area of the wandering of birds generally, and of Petrels in the
present case, then we may be able to account for such a rush as
related above. Meanwhile we think it safest to believe&mdash;without
theorising&mdash;that this unusual appearance was a local movement,
caused by unity of circumstances, affecting a large local
colony in the neighbourhood of the N. Unst lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcidæ.</span>&mdash;Auks, Razorbills, Guillemots, Puffins, "Marrots,"
"Tysties" (Black Guillemots).&mdash;<i>In Spring.</i>&mdash;On February 19th
a flock of Black Guillemots ("Tysties") "first arrived, very
early," at N. Unst; and at same place a year afterwards&mdash;<i>viz.</i>,
in January 31, 1887, we find, under "Marrot"&mdash;"flocks of,
flying past," W. to E.; "<i>rarely</i> been seen so soon." (Note in this
connection our extremely early and fine spring of 1877, until
checked slightly, between March 10th and 17th, by the severe
snowfall and keen frosts.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span></p>

<p>Returning to 1886:&mdash;By March 12th to 22d, numbers of
Guillemots and Razorbills rushing by thousands on the latter
date at Isle of May, the only station sending returns for March.
In April, abundance of Razorbills and Puffins on the rocks by
14th at N. Unst; but the note (1886) is given on date of 7th,
"not so early as last year." Puffins arrived "after; N.W.,
light breezes. First arrival later than usual." By the 22d
160 Puffins (estimate) settled down to breed on the rocks as
usual at N. Unst.</p>

<p>At Pentland Skerries, Puffins arrived on the 11th April; and
Common Guillemots were seen passing east on the 23d&mdash;mod.
S.E. wind. At Isle of May, a large number on 6th April and on
12th. By the 18th May, Puffins "are now laying" at Isle of
May. By 11th June, young were first seen at N. Unst of
Puffins and "Tysties." No records in August.</p>

<p>On September 2d, all Marrots, Razorbills, and Puffins left the
rock at N. Unst; but on October 18th, Tysties re-appeared
(three in number)&mdash;with N.N.E., strong breeze&mdash;and stayed six
days. No other records.</p>

discriminate the two species.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Mr G. H. Caton Haigh writes that the Turtle Dove has been very common
during the summer in the neighbourhood of Grainsby, North-East Lincolnshire.
About the middle of June one of the keepers saw a flock of twenty or thirty at
Cadeby. The same man also saw eight in Grainsby Healing during the third
week in August. Another keeper had seen a pair or two about Beasby Wood,
and a pair in an orchard in the village of Grainsby all through the summer.</p>

30th: "Concerning the birds which, I think, must be the
'stone-runners,' and their manœuvres, it was very amusing to
watch them. The birds were first seen in an eastward direction,
and I should think thousands, for when in close contact they
had the appearance of a small black cloud; at other times in a
long line and half circle, and so on. After they had finished
their exercise they separated into two parties, one passing to
the westward at no great distance from the vessel, and the other
disappeared in the direction where first seen. Sometimes they
would rise so high in the air, that they could not be seen without
a telescope, at other times apparently touching the water."</p>

over towards the N.E.; the passing over lasted ten minutes.
On many other days later have I also seen small parties of
'<i>Corvidæ</i>' hurrying N.E.</p>

<p>"On March 18th, I saw a Black-Headed Bunting; on the
19th, White and Pied Wagtails arrived. Now the Pied have
left, and quantities of the White remain and have begun to build.</p>

<p>"On the 23d, an extraordinary migration of Cranes began, and
is going on at intervals now; they are usually flying in a N. or
N.E. direction, but yesterday I saw three flying S.E., which has
much confused me. On the 23d, a flock settled in the fields
near here for a short time. Soon after this flock had gone, no
less than nine flights, of from forty to one hundred birds in each
flock, flew over at intervals.</p>

<p>"Curiously enough Robins and Thrushes are only summer
migrants here; they arrived on the 24th.</p>

<p>"I heard the Chiffchaff on March 25th; and on the same day
was another great migration of Cranes.</p>

<p>"On October 15th was the great rush of migratory birds,
parties of various sorts continually passing the whole day to the
S.W."</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>As in 1885, the main body of immigrants crossed in two
great rushes, corresponding with the first and third weeks in
October. This was considerably earlier than the chief general
movements of the preceding year. The meteorological conditions
of the first period were easterly and south-easterly winds,
pressure system cyclonic, accompanied by much fog and thick
weather. During the second period the pressure system again
mainly cyclonic, but with very variable winds.</p>

<p>As usual Rooks, Daws, Hooded Crows, Starlings, and Larks,
occupy a considerable portion of the schedules. Chaffinches
also have crossed in extraordinary numbers. They are always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span>
numerous, but this autumn their migration has been in considerable
excess of previous years. With these exceptions,
however, there has been a singular and very marked falling off
in some species whose breeding range lies chiefly in the north
of Europe. This is specially noticeable in the small arrivals
recorded of Fieldfares, Redwings, Ring Ouzels, Bramblings,
Snow Buntings, Short-eared Owls, and Woodcocks. Taken
altogether, the migratory record for 1886 is a very poor one.</p>

<p>No wild Swans are recorded, the few entries in the schedules
having undoubtedly reference to escapes from parks and private
waters. Geese and Ducks have appeared quite as numerously
as in previous years.</p>

<p>The arrivals of rare and occasional visitants have been few,
those of chief interest being three Harlequin Ducks (<i>Cosmonetta
histrionica</i>) at the Farn Islands; the Mediterranean Black-headed
Gull (<i>Larus melanocephalus</i>), shot on Breydon Water,
near Yarmouth; a Purple Heron (<i>Ardea purpurea</i>), shot on
Oulton Broad, near Lowestoft; and the reputed occurrences of
the Snowy Owl (<i>Nyctea scandiaca</i>) close to the Languard <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Suffolk. Of much interest also is the arrival of Shorelarks
(<i>Otocorys alpestris</i>) on the coast between the Farn Islands and
Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The continued yearly observations show that on the East
Coast of England the principal points of arrival for migrants
are the mouths of the chief rivers, also those parts of the coast
which present either a flat and open shore, or cliffs of low
altitude. Considerable stretches of coast, which, as a rule, have
a high cliff line, make poor returns, or in some cases no schedules
are sent in, indicating a great scarcity of birds.</p>

<p>It is well known that migrants under certain meteorological
conditions travel at a great height, when it may fairly be
presumed that the physical features of the earth's surface, the
trend of mountain chains, or the course of great river systems,
have little to do in determining their line, which is from point
to point, and without deviation; yet in the vast majority of
cases, where migration is visible, birds travel at a comparatively
low altitude, so that when passing mountain chains, and even
hills of no great altitude, they invariably choose the lines of the
valleys, following depressions which, more or less, correspond
to the general direction of their course. In the Cheviots I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
have observed, for two years in succession, that the streams of
small migrants from Scotland follow those main valleys which
run nearest north and south, sticking closely to the lowest
levels, where the brushwood and bracken beds offer greater
privacy and security than the bare fell sides. Birds also, when
migrating, follow from choice low-lying tracks of land and river
courses in preference to elevated plateau and the summit line
of mountain ranges.</p>

<p>Bearing these facts in mind, we find that there is a very well-marked
line, both of entry and return, at the Farn Islands, on
the coast of Northumberland. Scarcely second to this is the
mouth of the Tees, both in spring and autumn. The North
Yorkshire coast, from south of Redcar to Flamborough, including
the north side of the headland, is comparatively barren, few birds
appearing to come in between these points. Bridlington Bay
and Holderness to Spurn and Lincolnshire, as far as Gibraltar
Point, give perhaps the best returns of any on the East Coast.
The north of Norfolk is poor, but there are indications in the
heavy returns annually sent from the Llyn Wells, Dudgeon,
Leman and Ower, and Happisburgh light-vessels, that a closely
focused stream pours along the coast from E. to W., to pass
inland by the estuary of the Wash and the river systems of the
Nene and Welland into the centre of England, and thence probably
following the line of the Avon, the north coast of the
Severn, and Bristol Channel, and eventually striking across the
Irish Sea, to enter Ireland near the Tuskar Rock, off the
Wexford coast. This route is undoubtedly the great and main
thoroughfare for birds in transit across England to Ireland in
the autumn. Large numbers of migrants also which pass
inland from the coasts of Holderness and Lincolnshire may
eventually join in with the great western highway by the line
of the Trent, avoiding altogether the mountainous districts of
Wales. These remarks will refer chiefly to the Passerine birds,
the <i>Accipitres</i>, <i>Limicolæ</i>, and <i>Gaviæ</i>, also Geese and Ducks,
when crossing land, travelling as a rule very high.</p>

<p>To return once more to the East Coast, the Norfolk seaboard
between Cromer and Yarmouth and the corresponding light-vessels
show a large annual immigration, but the returns are
less pronounced between Yarmouth and Orfordness. The coast
of Essex, with the northern side of the Thames estuary, is fairly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">- 53 -</span>
good; but the opposite coast of Kent, from the North to the
South Forelands, including the four Goodwin and the Varne
light-vessels, is a barren and pre-eminently uninteresting district
for arrivals, both as regards numbers and species, the chief
migrants seen being such as are following the coast to the south.</p>

<p>Those migrants, which in the autumn follow the East Coast
from north to south, pass directly from the Spurn to the Lincolnshire
coast without entering the Humber; and there are no
indications that they follow the shores of the Wash in and out,
but shape their course from about Gibraltar Point to the Norfolk
coast. To judge from the well-filled schedules sent in year by
year from the Shipwash, Swin Middle, Kentish Knock, and
Galloper light-vessels, a closely packed stream passes somewhere
from the coast of Suffolk across the North Sea in the line
of these stations, both in the spring and autumn, to and from
the Continent. Autumn migrants approaching the Humber
from the sea do not follow the course of that river into the
interior&mdash;that is from S.E. to N.W.&mdash;the line they take
invariably crosses the river diagonally, and is from E.S.E. to
W.N.W. This course is so persistently followed, that I have
observed year by year, on a migratory day, birds cross our fields
at the same angle. Supposing this course to be continued they
would strike the Trent at or near Gainsborough.</p>

<p>Except in one instance no returns have been obtained from
any stations on the south-east coast between the South Foreland
and St Catherine's Point, Isle of Wight. This is much to be
regretted, as it is known that a strong migratory highway runs
along the South Coast as well as on the French side of the
Channel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schedules</span>, etc., were sent to thirty-five stations, not including
the Isle of Man (five more), the schedules for which are
under Mr Eagle Clarke's charge. Of the thirty-five we have
received returns from fifteen stations. From these fifteen
stations we have thirty-eight filled schedules. We have again
received two schedules from Monach Islands; but, as in 1885,
they are again written straight across the schedule, irrespective
of columns. To enter all these notes in their right places and

<p class="caption4nb"><i>Diary from the Stations.</i></p>

<p><i>Butt of Lewis.</i>&mdash;Robert Agnew (replacing Mr Edgar, who is
now at Lochindaul, <i>q.v.</i>). Mr R. Agnew is a son of Mr Joseph
Agnew, late keeper at Isle of May (East Coast), now stationed
at Monach Isles, <i>q.v.</i> Mr R. Agnew sends, in all, two excellently
well-filled schedules from the Butt of Lewis. Under date of
November 9th, 1886, he writes: "I send you a schedule. I
hope you will find it of use. I would have sent it sooner, but
wrote to my father for the loan of a book to help me, and
waited till I heard from him." [Schedules sent date from
August 23d to February 7, 1887.] Mr Agnew continues: "I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
am surprised to see that most of the strange birds that I have
seen here are <i>single</i>. It must just be occasional stragglers that
we get from the flocks that are passing. It is also strange that
there are so few birds coming to the lantern, but the tower is
very high&mdash;120 feet&mdash;and perhaps that is the reason." [Mr R.
Agnew is right in believing that stragglers are all that can be
expected to appear at Butt of Lewis, though possibly in exceptional
seasons unusual numbers may appear. Birds "catch up"
at Cape Wrath and W. C. of Scotland. Remnants "catch up"
again at Butt of Lewis. But in easterly gales the "catch up"
of the land is often lost, and hundreds or thousands are carried
clear away to the Atlantic. See previous Reports.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
Mr Agnew continues: "I have marked a Hen Harrier, and by
the description in the book" [he having received the loan of the
book from his father&mdash;Mudie's "Birds"], "I think I am right.
He remained here for some time, and the poor Rock Pigeons
led a poor time of it. I also found a young Gull he had killed
and eaten. I was surprised to see it, because I did not think
that he would have attacked so large a bird. I measured the
wings, and found them to be 4 feet 2 inches from tip to tip."
[Mr R. A. sent me the wings, but they did not reach me, and
must have miscarried, but no doubt it was one of the common
species of Gulls; from the measurements, probably a Herring
Gull; or possibly&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, if the measurements are correctly taken
across the back and wings&mdash;an Iceland Gull. (See MacGillivray's
"Manual," under the said species, vol. ii., p. 247.)&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.] Mr R. A. says: "I only came here last summer, and
did not begin to keep records till near the end of August, but
another year I hope to be able to do better." [Meanwhile, we
can only thank Mr R. A. for his excellent commencement of
the work, which is well done.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>Later, in the second schedule, Mr R. A. writes: "There has
been nothing to record since the 25th of November." [Last
date of schedule.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] "The Snow Buntings have remained
with us all winter. All summer we had large flocks of
Solan Geese, till the first of October; after that there were a
few till the 1st of November; but since then (till February 7,
1887) <i>I have not seen one</i>." [These Solan Geese notes are always
interesting. Perhaps Mr Agnew will devote a separate schedule
to the day-to-day movements of Solan Geese another season.&mdash;J.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">- 57 -</span>
A. H.-B.] He continues: "On the 24th October I observed
very large flocks of sea-birds, fishing close to the lighthouse.
There were all sorts of them; I could not say how many, but
there must have been many hundreds. We saw them from
9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> till 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> After that there was not one to be seen
(where did they come from and where did they go?)." [We
believe they simply followed a vast body of fish&mdash;young or
adult&mdash;or <i>entomostracæ</i>, which "showed" on the surface, indicating
one of the strange, or little understood, migrations of
fish, or <i>entomostracæ</i>. One or two of the birds shot, and contents
of their stomachs examined, might have explained a great
deal. Possibly Mr Agnew may still be able to supply a note
as to the nature of their food at the time.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Monach Isles.</i>&mdash;D. Georgeson sends two closely written
schedules, but, as before stated, straight across the columns.
We will give them here <i>in extenso</i> as the simplest way of
writing them in.</p>

<p>Under date of December 1st, 1886, Mr Georgeson writes to
us thus: "I send you my two last schedules, filled up to date
of end of October. I received intimation of my removal from
this station to Sound of Mull, Tobermory. I expect the
'Signal' daily to take me to my new home. I do not know
what sort of a place it is as regards birds, but if you send me
schedules I hope to be able to give you a report, however
short."</p>

<p>[<i>Note.</i>&mdash;In January 1887 Mr Harvie-Brown had an opportunity
of interviewing Mr Georgeson, and having a pleasant chat, at
Sound of Mull Lighthouse. No schedules have come from it,
but the site is not good, and is much hidden by high land to
the westward. It gave us much pleasure, however, to make
Mr G.'s acquaintance, and thank him for his hearty co-operation
hitherto at Monach Isles.</p>

<p>We have pleasure here in fully quoting Mr Georgeson's last
schedules from Isles of Monach, where he is succeeded by Mr
Joseph Agnew, late of the Isle of May, who we are sure will
find Mr Georgeson's notes of interest and value.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>Mr Georgeson writes as follows: "Since my last report to
you ending December 1885, I have had little to add in the way
of forwarding your useful work regarding migration, and of the
numbers and varieties of sea birds passing or frequenting this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
station. I notice a visible decrease annually in the numbers
of both land and sea birds, a decrease attributed to the island
not being so quiet as it was some years ago, before the lighthouse
was built, when the birds had the island all to themselves,
and there was no one residing on it, but was only used by the
natives for grazing purposes. Now the keepers and their families
going round the island, the small birds are disturbed at the period
of incubation.</p>

<p>"In January and February a few Terns, Snow Buntings,
Twites, and Rock Pipits struck the lantern, the wind being
south. Of sea birds during those months I observed a few
Solan Geese, Scarts, Kittiwakes, Eider Ducks, Teal Ducks, etc.;
but as the breeding season came on they left.</p>

<p>"In March a pair of Shielducks visited the island, and after
remaining a few days, left, returning again in April (presumably
the same pair), and after nesting and having two young ones,
the four left in August. No Teal nor Eiders bred here this
season.</p>

<p>"In June a large flock of Pictarnies, a few Stonechicks,
Ringnecks (?), Sand Larks, and Twites came to the island (but
not in such large numbers as in former seasons). Wind from
south to west. They left with their young in August, the few
I saw leaving flying in a north-easterly direction." [This is
somewhat contrary to experiences, and no doubt is due to local
peculiarities of the configuration of the Outer Hebrides and land
communications with the mainland, but our data appear too
scanty to explain this. In this case "the few Mr Georgeson saw
flying in a N.E. direction," was with a wind from south to west.
Possibly they do this to catch up the Skye coast, or sooner
reach the shelter of the east coast of the Outer Hebrides.&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.] "In June also a pair of Tysties," continues Mr
Georgeson, "came to the island, and left with the young in
August.</p>

<p>"On the 2d September, wind N.E., all the Pictarnies left the
island, flying in a northerly direction." [This again almost
seems to indicate a movement towards the north first, before
returning south or in a south-easterly direction. Future careful
reports on directions of flight here and of winds at the time can
scarcely fail to prove of interest.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] "On the 4th
of September four Ravens&mdash;a male and female with their two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
young&mdash;I observed resting on the island, but, after remaining a
short time, they flew in an easterly direction towards the mainland.
On the 9th September we had a severe gale&mdash;wind variable&mdash;and
the island is quite deserted by land birds, the only
ones remaining being a few Twites. I caught several during the
gale dying from exposure. The only sea birds I can see are a
few Gannets fishing for food; but they too leave in the evening
in the direction of Barra. A few pairs of Curlews and a few
Herring Gulls returned with their young. On the 17th
September I observed a solitary Heron feeding around the
shore; and I witnessed a strange incident in connection with it.
On the 22d of the same month, while walking round the island,
I heard strange cries coming nearer and nearer from a southerly
direction, when the Heron got up a few yards from me, and
flew in the direction of the cries, it being hazy at the time, and
after the lapse of a few minutes I noticed three coming out of
the mist evidently overjoyed at seeing one another. They flew
round and round, for some time, and then flew off in a north-easterly
direction&mdash;the wind E.N.E., fresh.</p>

<p>"On the night of the 4th and 5th October a great number of
birds struck the lantern, strange to say the greater number of
them being Snipe; but there were also Mavises, Blackbirds,
'Marsh' (<i>i.e.</i>, Meadow) Pipits and Rock Pipits, and a few
Pictarnies, all seemingly young birds of the year; but I was
surprised to see the Pictarnies, as they had all left, and none
had been seen about the island for some time; and these have
evidently been migrating. The island appears to be quite
deserted by land birds in the day time. On the night mentioned
the wind was variable&mdash;from S.E. to S.W., with drizzling
rain. On the 7th October I observed a large flock of Shielducks
coming from N.E., and after resting a short time, they got up and
flew off south, the wind being at the time S.W." [Report ending
31st October 1886. Here ends Mr Georgeson's notes on Monach.]</p>

<p>[Now Mr Joseph Agnew takes up the tale, and we make no
excuse for quoting his letters: "We had to leave the May a
day after the time I expected when I last wrote you, and
therefore had not time to visit you at Dunipace, when passing
Larbert on our way to Oban." On arriving at Monach Mr
Agnew expresses surprise at the universal and populous distribution
of the Rock Pipit at all stations, S., E., N., and W., where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">- 60 -</span>
he has been. He then describes the Tystie (or Toistie of
Monach), <i>i.e.</i>, the Black Guillemot, both in winter and summer
plumage. Mr Agnew sends a schedule dating December 3d to
30th, contents of which will be found under species further on,
and where Monach is mentioned, any remarks under species
may be read as continuous with Mr Georgeson's Diary.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Rona</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>South Rona</i>).&mdash;Messrs Dunnet and M'Gaw send
two fairly well-filled schedules, strictly adhering to columnar
arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Kyleakin.</i>&mdash;D. MacCulloch and John Clyne send one well-filled
schedule, but light, dating February 1st, 1886, to
January 1st, 1887.</p>

<p><i>Skerryvore.-</i>-Thomas Dawson and William Charleson send
three well-filled schedules, dating January 27th to December
9th, 1886. Mr D. writes: "Birds scarce here all summer.
Not one seen between 7th May and 13th September. On
September 6th a Scart was seen by us fishing about the rock.
Sometimes it came ashore for a short rest, then into the water
again. Did not appear to be a bit frightened. We amused
ourselves casting stones at it for a time, still it did not go away
far from us. It is the first we have seen of the season;
not one single Scart seen here during the breeding season. We
left it after a time. At night, after lighting time, a strange
noise was heard on the top dome. One of the keepers&mdash;Mr
Charleson&mdash;went aloft and found the Scart sitting very comfortably
on the cage for cleaning the chimney, with his head
under his wing, asleep. He never saw Charleson coming to it;
but the latter made a grab at it, but missing his mark, the bird
got clear off. Several Eiders are seen now, mostly males
(October 1st, 1886); one flock of thirteen yesterday, and only
one female among them. Numbers of Solan Geese seen every
day here fishing." [We would be glad of a schedule or two
devoted entirely to Solan Geese and their daily movements.&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;"On the 6th a great 'rush' of small birds here last
night. Never saw anything like it nor so many different kinds.
They commenced to strike the lantern at 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 5th;
and continued all morning of 6th. I cannot give you any idea
of numbers, but no doubt hundreds were flying round the light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">- 61 -</span>
Most in number were Skylarks and Thrushes; Wheatears next;
and a great number of Snipes were seen. I have noted in the
schedule the actual number of the different kinds we saw on
the lantern and the time they struck, but no doubt many more
of the same species hovered round the light all night. I saw
several Sand Larks, but only one struck. Wind S.E. to S., rain
and haze. They nearly all struck on the north side of the
lantern. I was standing on the balcony when the Woodcock
struck, and it fell stunned at my feet, and I caught it before it
had time to recover. This is the only one I have ever seen here.
I may mention the names of the species seen so far as recognised:
Mountain Thrushes, Common Thrushes, Skylarks, Titlarks,
Wheatears, Blackbirds, Woodcock (first seen here by me),
Robins, Wrens, Redstarts, Ring Ouzels (Mountain Thrushes are
therefore either Fieldfares or Red wings), '<span class="smcap">Oxeyes</span>' (and another
small bird a stranger to me)." [The Oxeye&mdash;so-called&mdash;is really
a Gold-crested Wren, as described: and the other small bird,
from description, is probably a Willow-Warbler (or Willow
Wren).&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] In the same letter Mr Dawson encloses
an insect [the Silver Gamma Moth.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.], and says:
"I enclose an insect. I got it this morning stuck to the side of
the kitchen window. We don't know what it is. It has likely
wandered off here with the rush of birds the two previous
nights. It appeared to be quite dormant when I found it
(date of 7th October).</p>

<p>"Great numbers of birds again last night, but not nearly so
many as the previous night, and fewer species. Wind N., and
heavy rain all night and morning. After this Mr Charleson is
to take note of the birds along with myself, so will get on
better. The second schedule will be soon filled up."</p>

<p>Under date of December 19th, Messrs Dawson and Charleson
say; "The Gannets have all left us some weeks back. The
scarcity of fish is no doubt the cause."</p>

<p><i>Dhuheartach.</i>&mdash;William Davidson and Jas. M'Guffie send
us four well-filled bulky schedules, as Dhuheartach has, along
with Skerryvore, participated in the rush of 5th and 6th
October, which appears to have been so universal all over the
East Coast also. By the schedules the species appear to have
been much the same as at Skerryvore&mdash;Larks, Mavis (many
young), Goldcrests, Snipe, Fieldfare, Wheatear, Robins, Firetails
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
(Redstarts), Starlings, Blackbirds, young Swallows, and
several Lapwings&mdash;the Larks predominating by hundreds, and
the Mavis by tens over the others, so far as observed.</p>

<p><i>Skervuile.</i>&mdash;John Ewing sends two well-filled schedules from
7th February to 26th December 1886. Under 25th March he
says; "There has been an abundance of Gulls and Boatswains'
birds up to <i>October</i>." On April 15th Solans are noted as seen
night and morning during July, August, and September. Rush
is also distinctly participated in on 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th. (See
under species for details.)</p>

<p><i>Rhinns of Islay.</i>&mdash;Peter Anderson and Mr Ducat.&mdash;Besides
sending five regular schedules, fully filled up, Mr Anderson has
also, in a very neat and efficient way, kept a still more minute
day-to-day record on his own plan. We now have these for
the month of February. When we have a schedule of this description
for every month in the year, we think it may prove
desirable to publish the series <i>seriatim et literatim</i>. The
statistics could not fail to be serviceable. Thousands of Larks
seen passing south for days during the October rush. They
write; "We think if you had been here on the night of 5th and
morning of the 6th October, you would have seen migration to
your heart's content. I have never seen anything like it before.
About 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> they commenced, and increased until 10, when
it was something grand to see, and continued up to 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> of
the 6th, making a perfect concert of sounds&mdash;even the drums
were not awanting&mdash;as the small birds striking the lantern and
dome answered for the small drum, and the larger ones at odd
times for the big drum. I will here mention a list of as many
of the birds as I could distinguish, but I will make no attempt
at numbers, as they were simply innumerable:&mdash;Redwings,
Lapwings, Larks (these three the most numerous), Thrush,
Missel-Thrush, Moorhen, Robins, Goldcrests, one Blackbird, one
Teal Duck (both latter caught), Blackbirds, Water-rail, Terns,
Starlings, and numerous other kinds I did not know. Weather
thick, with haze and rain: wind S.E. to E. The birds seemed
all to be flying against the wind. One Woodcock seen. Last
night, 7th October, we had scarcely a bird, although it was a
night of rain; but the wind was from the north." [This account
of the great rush is most interesting and valuable.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
"The rush continued till 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> of the 6th, but then eased a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span>
good deal, but numbers kept flying on till daylight. There
were numerous Moths about the lantern on the nights of the
5th, 6th, and 7th." [Schedules give more interesting items.&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.] Mr Anderson adds the note: "I forgot to mention
that the weather has for the past few days been very close
and warm. On the morning of the 5th, at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the glass
stood outside at 62½°, and has been about 60° for several days,
with very heavy rain." On the 18th December occurs the
following note: "On the 18th I was inland for a mile or so,
and saw two flocks of Larks (about 1000 each), and a flock of
Starlings of from 1200 to 1400. I never saw so many Snipe
on this island before. By the 22d thaw had set in, and they
were all gone." [<i>Note.</i>&mdash;When we were shooting in Ardnamurchan
in January 1887, though Woodcock were fairly plentiful,
we never saw Snipe so scarce in Mingary Park. The suddenness
of the rush, short space of time occupied, and complete
departure south in December at once accounts for this.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Lochindaul.</i>&mdash;James Edgar sends three well-filled schedules,
and observes that no schedules appear from our Report to have
been sent for some years back. We are very glad again to
receive schedules from Lochindaul, which appears to be a
favourable situation for observations. Mr Edgar's last station
was N. Unst, whence he sent us schedules. Mr Edgar says of
Lochindaul: "Very few birds are attracted to this light, owing
to part of the light being red, and the land side of the lantern
being dark, although there are plenty of birds in the vicinity of
the station. Most of the observations I have made are during
the day time, and I only entered each species the first and last
time seen, and any unusual flocks seen during the season. I
gave up taking notes at end of October, owing to illness, and I
was invalided from then till recently" (dated 17th January
1887), "which accounts for the lateness of sending in the
schedules."</p>

<p><i>Lamlash.</i>&mdash;David M. Scott and Robert Brown send a light
schedule, except on the 6th October, when they appear fully to
have participated in that extraordinary rush. "We could make
out Curlews, Lapwings, Thrushes, Goldcrests, Linnets, Blackbirds,
Wrens&mdash;the <span class="smcap">largest number ever seen in one night at
this station</span>;" further proving the magnitude and wide-spread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
character of the 1886 autumn migration, as well as its singularly
compressed nature.</p>

<p><i>Turnberry.</i>&mdash;Andrew Nisbet and William Begg send three
well-filled day-to-day schedules. Curiously enough, the "rush"
of October&mdash;which is quite the feature of our 1886 Report&mdash;is
only comparatively emphasised here; but while the emphasis
is moderate, it is also quite equally pronounced when compared
with records at the same station. Thus, whilst only 1, 2, or 3
birds struck, or were seen at the lantern all through the season,
a spring movement was more observable about the 10th February;
and the autumn migration rush was emphasised by 13
birds at the lantern on the famous 5th and 6th October, and
5 the following night. Thus, comparatively speaking, the rush
was also apparent on that date as elsewhere. All returns at
other dates are light.</p>

<p><i>Corsewall.</i>&mdash;An <i>unsigned schedule</i>, well filled and neatly executed,
to hand, dating February 4th to October 29th, shows an
early spring migration, also in February, of Starlings, Thrushes,
and Larks; and "a great rush" of Blackbirds, Thrushes, and
Larks (both male and female), and Goldcrests, began to strike
at 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and continued till daylight. A great many killed of
all kinds. Upwards of 100 got in the morning. S.E. fresh
breeze, fog and rain. Short, sharp, sudden, and vast, as we do
not find another entry till 23d.</p>

<p><i>Portpatrick.</i>&mdash;Mr James Beggs has the remark [which we
perfectly agree with, and the reasons for which will shortly
appear more decidedly, we believe, when Mr Service treats of
the migration of birds in the Solway district, in his intended
"Fauna of Solway."&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] to the effect that: "The
migration of birds again very slight this season. As I remarked
to you in my schedule last year, I think it is our prevailing
winds from the west which keep the birds inland. You will see
in my above notes where the winds are easterly." The easterly
winds referred to occur throughout all the dates where any
occurrences are recorded, <i>viz.</i>, on the 4th and 15th September,
October 4th, 5th, to 9th, and January 7th, 1887, at which latter
date a "great rush" of Larks, coming from the N.W. and going
S.E., is recorded. Again, the October 4th, 5th, and 6th rush
is distinctly recorded. <i>Not a single record is entered under a
westerly wind.</i> They naturally pick up (catch up) the trend of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">- 65 -</span>
the coast south of Clyde in any winds, but <i>normal westerly
winds</i> may&mdash;and do&mdash;confine them to <i>normal routes more than
easterly winds do</i>. Thus, if we had had no easterly winds at
this station at all, the probability is that <i>no migration</i> would
have been observed; but the <i>more normal</i> route <i>more inland</i>
would have been followed. Locally, Mr E. Service is working
at these routes with good effect.</p>

<p><i>Mull of Galloway.</i>&mdash;Alex. Murray and John M'Quarrie send
three excellent returns. Considerable movements of birds are
noted, but again October 4th and 5th have pre-eminence and
accentuation.</p>

<p><i>Little Ross.</i>&mdash;Neil M 'Donald and Robert M'Intosh send three
well-filled schedules&mdash;every line filled. Under date of 6th
December, N. M'D, writes: "I beg to send you two schedules,
which are all we have. We are marking the birds as we see
them on long sheets of paper lined off like the schedules, but
when copying them off, I find I have more than will fill another
schedule during October and up to date. Please forward two
more. Trusting our schedules will meet your approval, etc."
[Yes, they are excellent, and we have three fully filled, showing
the same results and rush marked off in October as elsewhere.
Birds seem well known; yet I think a copy of Johns' Birds
should be sent here and to several more stations.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdidæ.</span>&mdash;Thrushes, Dipper, Blackbirds, Fieldfare, Ouzels,
Redwings, "Mavises."&mdash;We find records principally of "Thrushes"
between 4th and 22d February at Skervuile (one only on 9th),
and at Turnberry and Corsewall (both south of Clyde), on seven
dates, but all light. [Thus most of the February early migrants
presumably turned across from Clyde to Forth,&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
Prevailing wind, S.W. and S.</p>

<p><i>In March.</i>&mdash;Light records at Turnberry on 8th of Thrushes;
and north of Clyde single birds at Rona, Skye, and at Skerryvore
on 12th, 22d, and 24th. Light records at Skervuile of
Fieldfares and Blackbirds on 21st and 25th, and single record
of Blackbird at Turnberry (S. of Clyde) on 25th. [Thus while
as usual most of the prominent stations report, the returns both
N. and S. of Clyde are light, and almost too general to utilise as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span>
indications of routes.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] Prevailing wind in March,
strong or light, S. and S. easterly. In May&mdash;3d, 4th, and 5th&mdash;we
have a number of Thrushes and Starlings reported from Mull
of Galloway in fog and mist, along with Starlings&mdash;twenty-two
killed on 3d, and eleven on 4th. Wind, strong south breeze.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;First movements noted are 26th and 27th of
August at Rona, Skye, of "Mountain Thrushes" (probably Ring
Ouzels). [This name is applied to both the Redwing, Fieldfare,
and Ring Ouzel, in different parts of Scotland, but most correctly
to the latter. The date also is more in favour of the record of
Ring Ouzels, as about the dates mentioned they begin to frequent
gardens and orchards for berries, etc.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] And at
Mull of Galloway and Little Ross, of Blackbirds and Ring
Ouzels. Wind, S. and S.E., fresh to strong. [These are also probably
migrants from the vicinity of the stations.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
In September a flight of Thrushes on the 4th at Portpatrick.
Indication at Kyleakin (N. of Clyde), on 24th, of same species;
also on 13th, at Mull of Galloway, of Blackbirds, and larger
numbers in flocks at latter station on 22d and 24th. Redwings
are noted as early as 20th at Rhinns of Islay only. But in
October the numbers of records are very great, too numerous to
give in detail. Thus we find the following stations participate:&mdash;Skerryvore,
ten dates between 5th and 19th. Rush distinct
on the 5th, 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, till 4.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on 6th, of "Mountain" and
Common Thrushes. Wind, light S.E., and heavy rain. One
Blackbird on 6th. At Dhuheartach on 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, and
8th. Records of Mavis, 100 all night of 5th, 6th, S.S.E.; Fieldfare,
one on 6th; one male Blackbird on 8th; wind N.W.
Single Thrush on 8th. [Shows the compressed nature of the
rush and preponderance, as elsewhere, of Common Thrush.&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.] At Skervuile, rush also on 5th and 6th of Thrushes,
Fieldfares (the latter in minority). Rush also, however, of
Blackbirds noted; entries extend from 2d to 31st, but only on
five dates, and all light except on 5th and 6th. [Emphasises
above remarks.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] At Rhinns of Islay records on
ten dates between 4th and 28th, of Redwings. [Query, were
these not Thrushes, or in some of the returns have not Redwings
and Thrushes equally done service? <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The Redwing is
<i>red</i> beneath the wing, and the Thrush or Mavis <i>yellow</i>. No
"Thrushes" so named appear in the Rhinns of Islay schedules,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span>
so perhaps "Redwings" do duty?&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] Blackbirds&mdash;quite
a number appear under dates of 22d, 25th, 27th, and 28th.
At Lochindaul also, while Thrushes seem to have been little
observed at the time of the rush, there are a few records, 19th,
27th, and 28th, and one of Blackbirds on 27th. [The position
of Lochindaul (Station CIII.) may sufficiently account for this;
nor, however, does the rush appear quite so heavy at Rhinns of
Islay (CII.) as it does at Skerryvore (XCIII.), nor at Dhuheartach
(XCIV.), whilst Dhuheartach is lighter than Skerryvore. This
may or may not indicate that the great body of the migrants
have passed to the westward of Rhinns of Islay and even
of Dhuheartach, making for the Irish coast. It will be interesting
to note what our Irish Committee report upon this.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>At Turnberry (S. of Clyde) records date 2d, 3d, 5th, 6th,
and 18th, but all are quite light, and no rush whatever is
apparent on 5th and 6th October, only records of one, two,
three, or four Thrushes, Blackbirds, and Ring Ouzels being
entered.</p>

<p>At Corsewall (S. of Clyde), 2d and 3d of Thrushes (only three
or four each time), but "great rush" of Blackbirds on 5th, and
of the latter single records on 23d and 29th. Winds as generally&mdash;easterly.
[<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Thus routes of Blackbirds and Thrushes
appear to have been rather different in 1886. <i>Compare</i> with
reports from other stations.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>At Mull of Galloway.&mdash;Bush indicated pretty distinctly, and
striking all night of 5th, mingled with a few Blackbirds, some of
which were killed at light. Large flocks seen all day of 6th.
Dropping in up to 28th.</p>

<p>At Little Boss, on 3d October, four Thrushes&mdash;S.E., fresh&mdash;three
killed; haze.</p>

<p>So much for the October rush at all stations yielding returns;
and we have enlarged upon items here as illustrative of the
whole general character of the autumn migration of 1886.</p>

<p>In November, migration of Thrushes (<i>vera</i>) almost <i>nil</i>. Solitary
returns on 24th from Skerryvore, and from Turnberry and
Little Boss. But a few more records of Redwing, Fieldfare, and
Blackbird at same station. In December one single Thrush on
8th at noon at Dhuheartach; and a few Blackbirds and Redwings
on 17th, 18th, and 20th at Rhinns of Islay. <i>No returns of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">- 68 -</span>
Turdidæ S. of Clyde.</i> No returns of <i>Turdidæ</i> anywhere in
January 1887.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolinæ.</span>&mdash;Wheatears (often called "Stonechats;" a name
more correctly applied to another species of the group), Stonechat
(a small bird having the head black in the male and dark-brown
in the female), Whinchat, Redstart, etc.</p>

<p><i>In Spring</i>, Stonechats (?) arrived at Rona, Skye&mdash;[no doubt
<i>these</i> are Wheatears; but it is hard to say in all cases which are
intended.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]&mdash;on the 24th March, and on same date
at Skervuile&mdash;S.S.E. breeze, hazy; also on the same date at
Turnberry. On 4th of April, one pair arrived to breed at
Rhinns of Islay, followed by several pairs on the 5th and 6th,
which remain to breed. On 30th April, and one or two other
dates, straggling birds seen at Dhuheartach, and again at Turnberry.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Wheatears are recorded by name (correct
name) at Butt of Lewis and at Little Ross; and what are also
all probably Wheatears, but called (erroneously) Stonechats (see
also last Migration Report, p. 100), at Rona, Skye, Dhuheartach,
Turnberry, and Mull of Galloway, all on dates between
18th and 31st August. Rushing on 21st and 22d South
of Clyde, continuing all through September, with a rush at
Skerryvore; but only two at Dhuheartach on 13th. Migration
continued up to, but not beyond, the 7th October, and participated
in the rush of 5th and 6th at Skerryvore, and also at
Skervuile, thus apparently taking a different route from that
chosen by the Thrushes (see <i>antea</i>, <i>Turdidæ</i>). The only other
species mentioned are a few Whinchats; a Redstart at Dhuheartach
on 23d May, three ditto at Mull of Galloway on 27th
August, two ditto at Little Ross on 13th September, and one
ditto at Skerryvore on 6th October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviinæ.</span>&mdash;Robins, Blackcap, Blue Throated Warbler, Whitethroat,
"Redbreast."&mdash;In Spring, two records only, at Rona,
Skye, and Skervuile on 24th and 25th March. [All through
this Report there seems to be a similarity of dates of occurrences
at these two stations, even in single records. Why they should
apparently be so much <i>in touch</i> with one another is not easily
understood at present; unless it is simply similarity of positions
affecting local migrations in a similar way.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;August 19th and 27th, singles. September.&mdash;Robins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span>
from Rhinns of Islay, Lochindaul to Lamlash (N. of
Clyde), and Turnberry and Little Ross (S. of Clyde) all light.
In October no great rush apparent anywhere, ranging in small
numbers at all stations through the month.</p>

<p>One record in November at Little Ross; and four dates, 17th
to 20th December, at Skerryvore and Rhinns of Islay, at which
dates there appears to have been some slight movement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopinæ.</span>&mdash;Goldcrest, "Gold-Crested Wren," Willow
Warbler, "Willow Wren."&mdash;In Spring, two solitary Willow
Wrens killed at Rhinns of Islay. "Great numbers of different
kinds of Wrens on 11th May at Corsewall" [Please send wings.
We have only one <i>true</i> Wren in Britain. The Goldcrest and
Willow "Wrens" (<i>sic</i>) belong to the Warbler group.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>No records again till September, from 5th to 22d. Goldcrests
are given on nine dates; but very few at Rhinns of Islay,
Turnberry, Corsewall, and Little Ross.</p>

<p>Many entries in October. A "great flock" of Goldcrests at
Little Ross; many struck and killed. Eight also appeared on
4th, 15th, and 8th at same place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accentorinæ.</span>&mdash;Hedge Sparrow, or Blue Janet.&mdash;One on 25th
March at Skerryvore, and one at Butt of Lewis (N., fresh
breeze, cloudy) on 23d September.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalinæ.</span>&mdash;Reed Warbler, Sedge Warbler.&mdash;At Dhuheartach
one Sedge Warbler. On September 3d, one ditto
at Little Ross, and one same place on 7th October; wind in each
case light S.E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paridæ.</span>&mdash;Titmice.&mdash;In April one Titmouse (?) seen on 27th
and 28th at Turnberry; and at same place, one on 10th May.</p>

<p>In August a number at Mull of Galloway 22d, and all night
of 30th. Occurrences between 22d and 30th, and on 27th at
Turnberry. On September 1st and 3d a few at Turnberry, and
two or three on 21st and 24th, same place. In October one bird
on 6th at same place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytidæ.</span>&mdash;Common Wren, "Kitty Wren."&mdash;Two dates
in April at Turnberry; one on 6th May at Skerryvore.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;Two at Corsewall on 21st, and five on 22d; and
three on 20th at Little Ross, and one on 22d of September.
In October, single records at Rona, Skye, 15th; Skerryvore,
6th; Rhinns of Islay, 2d; Lochindaul, 8th; and two, same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
place, on 22d. Latest two on 13th November at Little Ross, and
a few other scattered records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillidæ.</span>&mdash;Wagtails.&mdash;In March, a pair on 21st at Lochindaul;
in May, one Wagtail at Dhuheartach, on the 8th&mdash;strong
S.W., clear; and one Yellow Wagtail, same place, on
23d&mdash;light E. airs.</p>

<p>In August two "Grey Wagtails" [are these grey, or have they
any yellow about them?] at Dhuheartach on 27th; and eighty-nine
Wagtails on 28th&mdash;a rush. A number of entries in schedule
for September, ranging from 1st to 24th, at Dhuheartach,
Rhinns of Islay, Lochindaul, Mull of Galloway, and Little Ross,&mdash;bulking
in largest numbers south of Clyde, twenty to thirty,
on 1st September,&mdash;a rush co-existing with that at Rhinns of
Islay above on 28th August. A flock at Little Ross on 27th
September&mdash;winds S. and E. In October a number on 9th at
Lochindaul; and a few entries for Lochindaul, Skerryvore, and
Little Ross. Two on 19th December at Rhinns of Islay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillidæ.</span>&mdash;Pipits, Meadow Pipits, Rock Pipits, Titlarks,
"Mosscheeper," "Tang Sparrow" (<i>i.e.</i>, Rock Pipit), "Marsh
Pipits" (<i>i.e.</i>, Meadow Pipits).&mdash;One record at Skervuile in
February; one in March (20th), same place.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn.</i>&mdash;All day "Mosscheepers" at Butt of Lewis
[are these Meadow or Rock Pipits?], and scattered birds on
four dates of Titlarks at Dhuheartach. In October a rush of
Titlarks, 5th and 6th, at Skerryvore; but only single or light
returns from Dhuheartach at same time; also two only
at Skervuile all the month. Two on 19th December at
Dhuheartach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscicapidæ.</span>&mdash;Flycatchers.&mdash;The only records are in August,
on 27th, 29th, and 30th, at Mull of Galloway. S.E., fresh, or
fog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinidæ.</span>&mdash;Swallows, Martins, Sand Martins.&mdash;In April
24th&mdash;"Swallows first seen" at Corsewall; four at noon at
Rhinns of Islay, one with a speckled head, the first seen, on
27th. In May, a rush appears on 7th, and again on 6th to 8th,
at Rhinns of Islay and at Lochindaul. A few single records at
Dhuheartach, Lamlash, and Little Ross; one at Kyleakin on
26th June&mdash;all of Common Swallow.</p>

<p>Autumn movements all September recorded from Rhinns of
Islay; "flocks" at Mull of Galloway on 3d; and at Little Ross,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span>
"large flock" on 14th. Flocks all day on 4th September at
Mull of Galloway, and other notices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillidæ.</span>&mdash;Finches, Linnets, Redpoles, Siskins, Sparrows,
Tree Sparrows, Brambling or Mountain Finches, Chaffinches.
Bullfinches.&mdash;In February one Bullfinch at Kyleakin; snow
on island. One Cock Sparrow at Dhuheartach on 27th May;
light E., clear; on rocks. One Linnet, same place, June 26th.</p>

<p>In August flocks flying about all day on 22d at Lochindaul,
and small flock at Little Ross on 19th. Linnets and Grey
Linnets, 2d, 6th, and 13th September, at Butt of Lewis (probably
Twites or Mountain Linnets), Rona, Skye, and Little
Boss. In October slight rushes between 7th, 8th, 9th, of
Linnets. One male Chaffinch at Rhinns of Islay. One Siskin
at Butt of Lewis on 29th. Hundreds again in November at
Kyleakin, and forty to fifty on 14th and 21st at same place;
sixty on 19th December; Grey Linnets at Lochindaul.
Occurrences date in October from 4th to 28th in numbers
ranging from one to ten (on 5th, 6th, and 8th at Dhuheartach,
and on 20th at Turnberry), twenty (on 8th at Rhinns of Islay),
and eleven to forty (on 28th at Turnberry). Direction of
winds, S. and E. and S.E. throughout. No more records except
one bird at Little Ross on 19th November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizidæ.</span>&mdash;Buntings, Snow Buntings.&mdash;Almost all the
returns relate to Snow Buntings. On the 15th and 17th May
a single bird was found on the island at Rhinns of Islay, and
one reporter adds the remark, "very late to be seen here."
Wind variable, strong.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn</i> there was a "rush" of Snow Buntings past
Skerryvore at or about midnight of the 27th September; wind
strong W., haze and rain. No notice of this rush is taken at
Dhuheartach or elsewhere. In October only two single records,
on 14th at Dhuheartach, and 18th at Rhinns of Islay; and in
November light records only at Butt of Lewis, Dhuheartach,
between the 15th and 25th (twenty on the latter date). In
December, thirty Snow Buntings on 14th at Rhinns of Islay
"all day." Not one return from any station south of Clyde.
Of Common Bunting or Corn Bunting we have one record in
April at Lochindaul, one on 4th October at Skerryvore, and
one at Lochindaul on the 1st. The Corn Bunting is not looked
upon by us as more than very locally migratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudidæ.</span>&mdash;Larks.&mdash;Of Larks there has been an enormous
movement. Absent entirely in April, June, July, and August;
scarcely any in May (only two entries on 4th and 9th at
Turnberry, with light or strong N.E. breeze).</p>

<p>In September the returns are still very light, indeed almost
absent; but in October during the whole month innumerable
records. Larks appeared at all the following stations sending
returns:&mdash;Rona, Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Skervuile, Rhinns of
Islay, Lochindaul, Turnberry, Corsewall, Mull of Galloway, and
Little Ross; but all notice of them is omitted in schedules from
the other stations sending returns, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;Butt of Lewis, Monach
Isles? <i>q.v.</i>, Barra Head, Kyleakin, Rhuvaal, and Lamlash.
[We are thus able to locate the stream with some exactitude.]
They appeared to be most abundant at Skerryvore, and at
Dhuheartach, "rushes" and "hundreds;" Skervuile, "rush;"
Rhinns of Islay (on 2d October), "thousands," and on 5th,
"numerous." Then S. of Clyde, "a great rush" at Corsewall;
"rush" at Portpatrick (4th October). All these large movements,
except where specified, were on the nights of 5th and
6th October.</p>

<p>In November only a few slight movements, 24th, 26th, to
29th at <i>Kyleakin</i> and at <i>Turnberry</i>.</p>

<p>In December light again at Dhuheartach, 18th to 27th; but
heavy on 18th and 19th at Rhinns of Islay, 1000 and 100;
but these may and probably were due only to local migration,
influenced by severe weather on mainland.</p>

<p>In January movements also of local importance and not
numerous, January being milder and more open on the West
Coast than December; but at Portpatrick a great rush is
described as going from N.W. to S.E., 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 12, during a
snowstorm. This may also, however, be only a local movement
still it is interesting as showing the <i>recognised line of flight</i>
spoken of by Mr E. Service. In Ardnamurchan small flocks
appeared at Kilchoan at once on the advent of a severe snowstorm
and S.E. gale of wind&mdash;a local movement, of course.</p>

<p>In February many light movements are entered, but none of
more than local interest. These occur at Skerryvore, Rona,
Skervuile, Turnberry, and Corsewall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturninæ.</span>&mdash;Starlings.&mdash;A considerable movement. In
February a number at Turnberry on 9th, and light returns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">- 73 -</span>
from Skerryvore, Skervuile, and Turnberry on other dates, and
at Corsewall. A few returns in March, none in April, two in
May, none in June and July. "Rushes" of old and young in
August at Rhinns of Islay on 18th, 19th, and 26th; wind S.W.,
fresh, or W., light. Rush also indicated on 22d at Lochindaul;
odd birds only at Skerryvore; 130 at Lochindaul on the 30th.
A few movements in September. South of Clyde&mdash;"Great
numbers" on 15th at Portpatrick. North of Clyde&mdash;Light
movements; eleven, twelve, sixteen birds at Kyleakin. In
October rushes recorded, especially at Skervuile, Lochindaul,
Turnberry, Mull of Galloway, at or about the date of the general
great rush of the year, <i>viz.</i>, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th October.
Light returns in November, and a few in December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvidæ.</span>&mdash;Rooks, Ravens, Crows, Carrion Crows, Hooded
Crows, Jackdaws, Grey Crows.&mdash;The <i>Corvidæ</i> generally show
movements during January (1887), February (1886), April
(Ravens), May (casual Carrion and Grey Crows or Hoodies),
June 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th, "great numbers of Crows"
all day at Mull of Galloway. August 18th to 27th, of Rooks,
Ravens, Grey Crows, Crows. Great flocks of Rooks on 21st at
Lochindaul, as also on 24th September no very heavy entries
at any stations, but "dense flock" on 21st October at Lochindaul,
and sixty on the 20th same place. Only one Crow seen
all November, and that at Butt of Lewis, the only return in all
that month. 500 Crows at Rhinns of Islay on 18th December&mdash;no
doubt a local migration. In January (1887), from 100
up to 500 at same place, 9th, 10th, and 17th&mdash;also local, no
doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselidæ.</span>&mdash;Swift, "Cran," "Black Swallow."&mdash;Only one
solitary record of one Swift on 27th August at Butt of Lewis.
Wind S.W., fresh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculidæ.</span>&mdash;Cuckoo.&mdash;Records: At Lochindaul, arrived 6th
May. Wind light S., clear, "flying S.W."</p>

<p>Also at Lochindaul, one rested on the rocks at 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the
6th July. Light W., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigidæ.</span>&mdash;Very few records of any Owls&mdash;At Dhuheartach,
on 4th May, an Owl rested on the rock. Fresh S. and fog.</p>

<p>At Mull of Galloway a Grey Owl seen on 5th September,
and again at same place on 21st October one Grey Owl came
to the light in pursuit of some small birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">- 74 -</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconidæ.</span>&mdash;Eagle, Hawks, Kestrel Hawks, Sparrow Hawks,
Buzzards, Game Hawk or Falcon.&mdash;[Merlins are not once named,
but no doubt some of the "Sparrow-Hawk" entries really apply
to the Merlin.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>In May.&mdash;A Kestrel on 5th at Dhuheartach, and a Buzzard
on 23d, both flying east, with E. wind. A Sparrow Hawk at
Rhinns of Islay.</p>

<p><i>In Autumn</i>, a few records of Hawks, Game Hawk (Rona,
Skye), etc., at four or five stations in August, and single birds
in September, including Buzzard and Falcon at Rhinns of Islay
on 20th. Also single birds at Skerryvore and Dhuheartach,
including a "Black Hawk" on 10th October at the former.
One record at Butt of Lewis of a Sparrow Hawk on 19th November.
There are fewer records of Hawks than usual. One
Eagle seen at Rona 2d January 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanidæ.</span>&mdash;Solan Geese.&mdash;First seen at Skervuile on 15th
April. Light N. wind; next at Rhinns of Islay, 100 in flocks,
from 4 to 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 11th May, and great numbers on 27th,
flying N. in the forenoon, and again on 31st. E.N.E. wind. In
June six seen at Lochindaul, and a few at Little Ross. The
migration of Gannets appears to have been quite intermittent
and uncertain here and on the N.W. coast.</p>

<p>By August 8th, at Rhinns of Islay, several young seen; and
by 15th to 18th in hundreds all day. Intermittent in numbers,
16th (some) to 30th (numbers), and 31st (all day) at Lochindaul.
None entered again till 9th and 11th October at Lochindaul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeidæ.</span>&mdash;Herons.&mdash;One record in February at Skerryvore,
sitting on rock on 13th. Wind fresh W., and rain. One record
in July at Rhinns of Islay, flying S.W.; W., clear on 16th.
One record in August at Little Ross on 19th. Singles or pairs
at four stations, <i>viz.</i>, Butt of Lewis, Skerryvore, Rhinns of Islay,
and Little Ross, on four different dates. Two in October at
Rhinns of Islay, and two in December at same place. None of
these appear to us at present to have any special significance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatidæ.</span>&mdash;Ducks, Geese, Swans.&mdash;In Spring two Eider
Ducks at Lochindaul, swimming near the shore on 29th March.
[It seems worth while to record the appearances of Eiders,
owing to their wonderful and yearly increase in the Outer
Hebrides within, our recollection since 1870, and earlier.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">- 75 -</span></p>

<p><i>In Autumn</i>, at Skerryvore, four seen on 14th, and at Dhuheartach
one Drake on 16th, and at Lochindaul one Duck on
30th. On 1st October two at Skerryvore, S.W., strong breeze;
and a pair on the 20th at same place. In November two males
and three females at Rhinns of Islay on the 4th, and two
females and one young male at Skerryvore on 15th.</p>

<p><i>Stock Duck or</i> Shieldrake.&mdash;One on 8th March at Rhinns
of Islay, S.E. breeze. Very occasional entries of Ducks (Wild
Duck) in April at Rhinns of Islay, from three to ten at a time.</p>

<p>Grey Geese [probably White-fronted.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] on 12th
and 25th at Rhinns of Islay. Wind northerly and westerly.
One Widgeon at Lochindaul on 16th September. A few scattered
notices of Geese, or Grey Geese, in October at Rona, Skye,
(six) on 12th, at Rhinns of Islay (Large Goose), and at Kyleakin.
In November 40 Geese at Rona, and flocks, 46 to 50, flying S.
on 4th at Rhinns of Islay; 100 on 5th, flying S.; wind S.E.,
fresh. All other lighter records, flying east, with S.W. strong
breeze. Barnacle Geese, five on 1st November at Rhinns
of Islay rested on island, and one seen on 3d at Butt of Lewis,
and five on 18th December at Rhinns of Islay, with "first snow."
Also records of Teal (all in October), 40 Brent Geese at Rhinns
of Islay on 6th, and 33 and 30 "Wild Geese" at same place
on 20th and 21st January 1887.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbidæ.</span>&mdash;Rock Doves, Turtle Doves, Wood Pigeon, &amp;c.&mdash;Two
records of seven and fifteen respectively at Rhinns of Islay
on 4th and 5th September. One Turtle Dove shot on 25th at (?)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallidæ.</span>&mdash;Corncrake or "Land Rail," Water Rail.&mdash;At
Rhinns of Islay, first heard 26th May. At Lochindaul, first
heard 20th May. At Kyleakin, first heard 25th May. At
Lochindaul, last heard or seen 7th August. At Rhinns of
Islay, one on island 29th September. At Rhinns of Islay, one
Water Rail killed on 5th. Fresh E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriadæ.</span>&mdash;Oyster Catchers, Plovers, Golden Plovers,
Grey Plover, &amp;c.&mdash;Oyster Catchers on 15th February at Lochindaul,
"first seen this year." Light, clear, and N.E. One
Plover at Rona 24th March, and "Sea Pies" at Dhuheartach
on 23d May, the only entries in Spring.</p>

<p>In August, flock of Golden Plover at Butt of Lewis on 30th.
Stray records at Rhinns of Islay and Lochindaul, and one record
of Grey Plover at former on 20th. S.W., fresh and rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span></p>

<p>Slight movement on 2d and 5th September at Rhinns of
Islay of Golden Plover, and "large number" on 12th at Turnberry,
and a number at Little Ross on 28th. No very heavy
records at any time. Flocks in October, but no records of important
movements. Three records in December 17th, 18th,
and 19th, at Rhinns of Islay. Few records of Oyster Catchers.</p>

<p>Lapwing, Ring Plover, Dotterel.&mdash;Very few light movements
in February, March, and April of Lapwings. Do. in July (one),
flocks on 19th August, and 30 on 30th, 100 at Rhinns of Islay
on 14th September, 40 on 24th, "great numbers" at Turnberry
on 14th September, 100 on 21st October at Rhinns of Islay,
and numbers on 9th at Lochindaul all day, and on 11th and
23d. No records of other species, or of Lapwings, at later
dates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacidæ.</span>&mdash;Woodcock, Snipe, Curlew, Whimbrel.&mdash;Whimbrels,
or Little Curlew, or "May Fowl," in small numbers
rested for four days on the rock at Dhuheartach on 11th to 14th
May. No other notice, spring or autumn.</p>

<p>Curlews&mdash;February, March, May, single records. In June
thirty to forty alighted on hill near Mull of Galloway, and
stayed three weeks and left. August&mdash;Flocks on 19th at
Lochindaul; thirty on 19th at Mull of Galloway; and a flock
at Little Ross on 3d. In September many light records;
heaviest, fifty at Rhinns of Islay, and a large flock and a small
flock on 1st at Little Ross, and a large flock of young Curlews
same place on 28th. In October a fair number of records; fifty
on 21st at Rhinns of Islay, and a number on 11th at Lochindaul;
twenty at Mull of Galloway on 20th.</p>

<p>Woodcock&mdash;At Lamlash, on 15th March, two birds at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>;
E., strong; and on February 1st, one at Kyleakin, 11.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>;
S., with snow on the island.</p>

<p>No more entries till October, when only three in all at Rona
(on 8th), S.E., fresh, "first seen;" one at Rhinns of Islay (22d),
N.E.; and one at Corsewall (25th), N.E., fresh, "struck and
killed." In November, one bird at Mull of Galloway on 19th;
and one, on 20th and 21st December, at Rhinns of Islay.</p>

<p>Considering that this was a most remarkable year for Woodcock
in Central Scotland, and in the West, in Ardnamurchan,
Mull, and many other places, it is remarkable how few have
been seen at lighthouses. Here in Stirlingshire thirty-five and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">- 77 -</span>
twenty-eight were killed on Torwood and Touch in two days.
The birds had been quite three weeks in the country. In
January 1887, 33½ couple were shot in seven days, and we
heard of total bags for the season of 160 to one gun in Ardnamurchan,
400 in Ross of Mull, 260 in north of Mull on one
property, etc., etc.</p>

<p><i>Snipe.</i>&mdash;A distinct "rush" apparent on the great migration
night of 5th October, but all other returns light except
"numbers all day" at Rhinns of Islay on 18th December.
The largest "rush" is recorded at Skerryvore on 5th October,
9.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> till 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 6th; light S. wind; eight killed
on lantern. All other records quite light; and Jack Snipe, only
three entries, <i>viz.</i>, on 8th October at Butt of Lewis, S., fresh;
at Skervuile on 6th, light E. and S.; and one killed at midnight
of 22d October at Rhinns of Islay. Of Sandpipers, Redshanks,
Dunlins, etc., there are only eight records in all in March, May,
August (2), September (2), October, and December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laridæ.</span>&mdash;Gulls we only will mention the more important
entries.</p>

<p>Cream-coloured Gulls (Iceland) [or Glaucous Gulls.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
"seldom seen here," at Rhinns of Islay on
January 18th, 1887. February 1886&mdash;"Iceland" Gull at same
place, flying E., noted as "rare," on 3d; light N. breeze. In
May a Richardson's Skua at Lochindaul on 28th, and all day
there again on 30th July. Thousands of Black Backed Gulls
and other Gulls on 14th September at Rhinns of Islay. "Dirty
Allens" at Dhuheartach on 31st October, and all November
numbers of Gulls at Skervuile. Iceland Gulls at Dhuheartach
on 12th December, and again at Rhinns of Islay on 7th.</p>

<p>Terns arrived on 20th May at Barra Head, and a flock stayed
a week at Little Ross and then left, after the 14th June. There
are only a few scattered records in autumn. The curious
unsettled behaviour of Terns, whether Arctic or Common, is a
subject worthy of remark during their breeding season. They
often occupy and then abandon their nesting places, apparently
without any reason, for it is not always that they leave on
account of persecution, though they are much more easily
affected by persecution than almost any other sea birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellariidæ.</span>&mdash;Petrels.&mdash;In September several all day at
Dhuheartach, and have been seen "flying south for a week
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">- 78 -</span>
past." [This is an interesting note as pointing directly to a
periodical migration of the Petrels. Of course how much such
may have been simply caused by increase or diminution of food
supply is at present difficult to determine.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>In October only two records, but both on 5th and 6th at
11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, struck, but were not killed. [They are
evidently thus included in the impulse and great migration of
this date. It is noteworthy that we have all through our past
reports seldom received definitive record of actual migration of
the Petrel till now.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colymbidæ.</span>&mdash;Divers, Northern Divers, Grebes, etc.&mdash;In
February, one G. N. Diver on 7th at Skervuile.</p>

<p>In March, one do. on 24th at same place. In April, no
records. In May, two at Lochindaul on 7th, and on 10th at
Kyleakin. No more records of G. N. Divers till 23d October,
when one was seen at Rona, Skye, "swimming round the island."
Then, 16th November, at Skervuile, and December 26th at same
place.</p>

<p>By collecting careful notes on the appearance, residence on
our coasts, and departure from different stations, much might
be learned of the reason why some northern species remain to
breed some seasons more than others, or remain longer resident
into the summer months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcidæ.</span>&mdash;Puffins, Guillemots, "Tysties," "Rock Birds," etc.,
Razorbills.&mdash;In April, a flock of 100 Puffins fishing around
Rhinns of Islay on 3d, and twelve Tysties or Black Guillemots
on 10th, "floating in the sound." In May, Tysties at Lochindaul
on the 20th, and Puffins&mdash;twenty&mdash;flying west on 2d, at
Kyleakin. In June, great numbers all day of Razorbills fishing
around Lochindaul. In August a few all day on 28th at same
place. In September, one young Tystie on 15th at Dhuheartach,
"eating fish on the rocks." In October on 19th and 21st <i>continuous
flocks</i>, 6 to 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, N., light, clear, flying south. This
"rush" of sea birds is almost as sudden and remarkable as that
of our land birds this year. A few still found in December at
Skervuile. No notices South of Clyde.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to note that not only has the number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">- 81 -</span>
stations making returns been largely augmented, but also that
the schedules have considerably increased in number from most
stations.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is pleasing, too, to observe the pains and evident
interest taken by most of the recorders. Our best thanks are
due to the observers above named for their invaluable co-operation,
and for the faithful manner in which they have filled in
their schedules. To Messrs Ainger (Eddystone), Baker (Smalls),
Clyne (Langness), Johnson (Longships), Jones (Start), Knott
(Bull Point), Lewis (Burnham), Nicholas (Nash), Rees (Skerries),
Walters and Johnson (Breaksea), Webber and Howells (Helwick),
and Work and Clague (Dee), additional and especial thanks are
due for sending the wings of the species unknown to them killed
or captured at their respective stations. The result of the first
efforts in this direction has been highly satisfactory; a very
considerable number of wings have been received, representing
the following species:&mdash;<i>Turdus viscivorus</i>, <i>T. musicus</i>, <i>T. merula</i>,
<i>T. torquatus</i>, <i>Saxicola œnanthe</i>, <i>Pratincola rubetra</i>, <i>P. rubicola</i>,
<i>Sylvia cinerea</i>, <i>S. atricapilla</i>, <i>Phylloscopus collybita</i>, <i>P. trochilus</i>,
<i>Acrocephalus phragmitis</i>, <i>Locustella nævia</i>, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>,
<i>Troglodytes parvulus</i>, <i>Motacilla rayi</i>, <i>Anthus pratensis</i>, <i>A. trivialis</i>,
<i>A. obscurus</i>, <i>Muscicapa grisola</i>, <i>Emberiza miliaria</i>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>,
<i>Caprimulgus europæus</i>, <i>Cuculus canorus</i>, <i>Gallinula chloropus</i>,
<i>Tringa alpina</i>, <i>T. canutus</i>, and <i>Procellaria leucorrhoa</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The weather during the week was of two very distinct types. In the first of
these a large anticyclone lay over Germany, France, and the southern half of
England; and while in all these countries bright, dry, and very warm weather
was being experienced, some of the maxima in England being as high as 87°,
that over the western and northern parts of the kingdom and west of Norway
was cyclonic, showery, and cool, with strong southerly and south-westerly winds.
Very little change occurred until September 1st, when the anticyclone in the
south began to spread west to Ireland, causing the wind to veer and lull, and
making the air somewhat cooler and drier. On the evening of this day, however,
a separate anticyclone was formed in the west, so that the wind veered to the
northwards over England and the Bay of Biscay, while it was southerly and
easterly in many other places. The conflict of air-currents brought about by
these conditions soon produced thunderstorms and heavy rains over France. The
change of temperature in England, owing to the northerly winds, rain, and heavy
clouds, was very large&mdash;London being 26° colder at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 2d than on the
previous day at the same hour. The shallow continental disturbances now moved
northwards to our Islands, and the week closed with thunderstorms of great
severity, prevailing in nearly all parts of France and the British Islands.&mdash;(From

<p>Up to the night of the 2d the conditions had been cyclonic and unsettled.
At the beginning of the week an anticyclone lay over the North Sea, while depressions
of considerable size, but of no great depth, moved northwards along
our extreme western coasts. South-easterly or southerly winds, therefore, prevailed
generally; in the west they were strong in force, and the weather cloudy;
but in the east and south-east light breezes and fine weather were reported. On
the 4th the thermometer exceeded 75° in many parts of England. By the 5th
the anticyclone had moved northwards to Scandinavia, and as it did so a second
high pressure system appeared over Spain. These conditions were accompanied,
as usual, by the formation of shallow depressions in the intervening regions, one
of which lay over the east of England on the morning of the 6th, subsequently
moving northwards to Scotland; and a second, which advanced over our south-west
coasts on the 7th, and ultimately filled up over the north-east of France.

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The weather during this period has been much quieter than last week, but conditions
have been by no means settled, and several depressions&mdash;mostly shallow&mdash;have
appeared in the neighbourhood of the British Isles. On the 17th the
deep disturbance which had crossed our Islands reached Holland, and was apparently
filling up. In the course of the day, however, a subsidiary disturbance,
more southwards, down our W. coasts. During the 18th and 19th the depression
over Holland and the subsidiary disturbance (which had then reached the Bay of
Biscay) dispersed gradually, and moderating north-easterly winds were reported
over the greater part of the United Kingdom. A depression was found in the
English Channel on the morning of the 20th; this, in the course of the ensuing
24 hours, moved northwards to the North Sea, where it eventually dispersed.
Its progress was attended by very heavy thunderstorms over the midland and
eastern counties of England; and on the 21st the phenomena were reproduced
over the northern districts. At the close of the week the weather over our islands
was under the influence partly of a well-marked depression over the Bay of
Biscay and partly of an anticyclone extending over Scandinavia. Easterly
winds, therefore, prevailed generally; in the N. they were light in force and the
weather fair, but in the extreme S. they blew freshly with occasional rain.</p>

fine but rather foggy elsewhere; later on the rain spread northwards over
England and Ireland, and the wind veered from E. to S.E. and S., with a rise of
temperature and damp, close air. Pressure highest over Sweden and the Baltic,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the week the distribution of pressure, temperature, and winds and
weather, were all continuously anticyclonic. The system was formed over the
British Islands on Sunday, the 21st, in a ridge which extended northwards from
a small anticyclone, which at that time lay over France. On the 24th the system
covered the North Sea, England, and the north-western half of France. For a
day or two more the anticyclone grew higher, temperature became very low over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">- 101 -</span>
the inland counties as the anticyclone increased, so that early on the 24th
minima were recorded as low as 27°. The centre of the system now moved westward,
and the temperature rose decidedly. On the 25th the anticyclone moved to
the westward of Ireland, and had afterwards decreased in intensity. The winds
during its prevalence were light to moderate at most of the coast stations, calm
inland; but the most striking feature was the continued prevalence of dense fogs.
At the close of the week the system was dispersing, and mild south-westerly winds
were setting in on our western and north-western coasts, with rain, increasing to
strong south-westerly winds, while large areas of low pressure skirted our north-western
and northern coasts.&mdash;(From Weekly Summary in "Daily Weather
Report," November 29, 1886.)</p>

<p><i>Agelæus phœniceus</i> (L.), Red-winged Starling.&mdash;October 27th,
Nash, one struck and captured at 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Mr Nicholas had intended
to forward this specimen to me, but during his absence
for a few moments it was most unfortunately carried off by a
cat. He had, however, no difficulty in identifying the bird
from the description given in John's "British Birds," and
promptly reported the occurrence. A skin of the species (an
adult) was at once forwarded to him in order to test his identification
of the bird, and he replied "that the bird killed very
much resembled the one sent, except that the yellow on the
wings was rather paler; the tips of the wings and the back of
the neck were more sooty black, and I think it was a little
larger;"&mdash;a description indicating an immature specimen.
During the late hours of the 26th of October and the early ones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span>
of the 27th an important migratory movement was taking place
at this station:&mdash;At 9.50 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, Missel Thrushes; at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
Bramblings; at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, Snipe (four killed); at 12.40 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
Redwings (two killed); at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, Wrens (one captured); at
2.10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, Robins, and Black Redstart killed; and finally at 3
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the Red-winged Starling. The wind prevailing at the time
was a strongly easterly breeze; the weather cloudy, with passing
showers of rain. Mr Nicholas is a most careful, intelligent,
and painstaking recorder, and shows particular interest in our
work, and there is little likelihood of his being mistaken in this
matter. As an unbeliever in the unassisted occurrence of
extra-Arctic American passerine birds in Europe, I would
suggest that this was probably an escape from some vessel
approaching the British coast.</p>

<p><i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, L., Starling.&mdash;The numbers and the frequency
of the occurrence of this species is again manifest in the returns.
It is impossible to do more than to refer to the diary portion of
the report for particulars. Mr Caton Haigh, in his notes from
the N.W. coast of Merioneth, remarks that many of the Starlings
wintering there left during the second week of February, large
flocks passing over flying due N. On the 26th of June, at 8
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, an immense flock passed over going S. It looked like a
long, narrow stream, half a dozen yards wide and at least half a
mile long.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Summary and General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>The Report for the West Coast of England and Wales, and
the Isle of Man, refers to the seasonal movements during 1886
of 104 species.</p>

<p>The first vernal migratory movement occurred on the 24th of
March, and was sustained until the 26th. During this interval
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span>
<i>Phylloscopus trochilus</i>, <i>Saxicola œnanthe</i>, <i>Pratincola rubicola</i>, and
<i>Hirundo rustica</i>, along with <i>Turdus iliacus</i>, <i>T. pilaris</i>, <i>Scolopax
rusticula</i>, and also <i>Turdus musicus</i>, <i>T. merula</i>, and <i>Alauda
arvensis</i>, were observed&mdash;all at the lanterns, save <i>Hirundo rustica</i>,
which occurred during the daytime. The weather prior to this
initiatory migration had been severe and unsettled, and the
movement was concurrent with the temporary prevalence of
favourable conditions (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>) over our Islands.</p>

<p>The spring immigrants flowed in gently at intervals during
April and early May. The only rush recorded was on the 23d
of April, when many Wheatears, Warblers, and "Flycatchers"
occurred&mdash;the movement being especially pronounced at the
Nash and the Eddystone; minor barometric depressions and
low temperature, the wind being N.E., had prevailed prior to
the 23d, on which day more favourable conditions set in, producing
moderate southerly and south-easterly gales, and a rise
in the temperature. The immigration of summer visitors extended
until the 10th and 11th of May, when <i>Phylloscopus
trochilus</i>, <i>Acrocephalus phragmitis</i>, and <i>Sylvia cinerea</i> were killed,
and <i>Cypselus apus</i> observed at Langness. Of the transvolant
spring migrants, <i>Numenius phæopus</i> was noticed at Langness on
the 16th of May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">August.</span>&mdash;The autumnal movements commenced with an
emigration of <i>Cuculus canorus</i>, <i>Cypselus apus</i>, and <i>Phylloscopus
trochilus</i>, several of which were killed at the Nash lantern on
the 1st of August. This was followed by movements of <i>Phylloscopus
rufa</i>, <i>Turdus torquatus</i>, <i>Sylvia cinerea</i>, <i>Saxicola œnanthe</i>,
<i>Anthus trivialis</i>, <i>Motacilla rayi</i>, <i>Cotile riparia</i>, and <i>Cypselus
apus</i>, extending from August the 3d to the 9th, and chiefly
observed at southerly stations. On the night of the 22d there
was a great rush of birds at the Nash, when some hundreds of
<i>Acrocephalus phragmitis</i>, <i>Sylvia cinerea</i>, and many <i>Saxicola
œnanthe</i> were flying around the lantern from 9 to 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
twenty-nine being killed. Emigrating summer visitors were
also observed on the 23d, 27th, and 31st of the month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">September.</span>&mdash;On the 3d there was a decided rush of birds at
the Nash, on which Mr Nicholas remarks as follows:&mdash;"There
was an enormous arrival of small birds, the greatest number
ever seen here at any one time." This singular movement
lasted from 2.10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 3.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, or a little over an hour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">- 117 -</span>
during which brief interval unfortunate individuals of the following
species perished at the lantern:&mdash;<i>Caprimulgus europæus</i>,
<i>Emberiza miliaria</i>, <i>Sylvia cinerea</i>, <i>Phylloscopus trochilus</i>, <i>Cuculus
canoras</i>, <i>Passer domesticus</i>, <i>Erithacus rubecula</i>, <i>Saxicola œnanthe</i>,
and <i>Turdus merula</i>.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> A general emigration of summer birds on
the 23d and 24th, when a very decided fall of temperature was
recorded, was the only other movement during the month.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> For further particulars of this interesting movement, <i>see</i> <a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">October.</span>&mdash;There were important migrations of summer birds
and partial migrants on the 3d, 4th, and 5th, commencing
simultaneously with the passing away of adverse meteorological
conditions (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_91">p. 91</a>). Afterwards the records indicate a complete
blank until the 18th, up to which day the weather was
exceedingly unsettled, with strong winds and gales. From the
18th to the 31st, conditions were quieter, with north-easterly,
easterly, and south-easterly winds, and under what may be
termed mildly unfavourable conditions (<i>see</i> pp. <a href="#Page_94">94</a> and <a href="#Page_96">96</a>), a
steady and unbroken flow of migrants was kept up; during
which the winter visitors first appeared at the stations, where,
also, the departing summer birds put in a final appearance for
the season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November.</span>&mdash;The only movement during the month took the
form of rush, and extended from the 22d to 27th. This was,
doubtless, occasioned by the outburst and prevalence of low
temperature (<i>see</i> Meteorological conditions, <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>) then experienced
in our Islands, causing birds&mdash;<i>Turdinæ</i>, <i>Alauda
arvensis</i>, <i>Vanellus vulgaris</i>, <i>Scolopax rusticula</i>, <i>Gallinago cœlestis</i>,
<i>Numenius arquatus</i>, and a few <i>Regulus cristatus</i>,&mdash;which would
otherwise have been contented to remain with us, to seek more
genial winter quarters.</p>

<p>The returns for this section of the coast again bear out the
opinions expressed in former reports,&mdash;<i>First</i>, That the main
body of the autumnal migrants reach the west coast of Wales
and the south-west coast of England&mdash;and probably Ireland, too&mdash;by
way of the Isle of Man; the north-western coast of England
only receiving a comparatively small share in these movements;
<i>Second</i>, That emigrants from Ireland, and other birds
migrating <i>viâ</i> Irish routes, strike the British coast at the mouth
of the Bristol Channel, along whose north shore it is believed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">- 118 -</span>
many pass. It seems probable, however, from a careful examination
of the records, that the right wing at least of these Irish
migrants extends as far south as the Land's-End stations, and
those from Land's-End to Start Point. This is made evident by
the several independent&mdash;if they may be so termed&mdash;and important
movements which are recorded in the diary, for this portion
of the coast alone, under the following dates; August 22d, September
3d, and October 24th, 25th, and 26th, and which not only
indicate the route followed, but also its origin (Ireland), by
reason of the circumscribed area affected.</p>

<p><i>Corvus cornix</i>, <i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>, <i>Asio accipitrinus</i>, <i>Bernicla
brenta</i>, <i>Fringilla montifringilla</i>, and <i>Passer montanus</i> are again
absent, or very rarely mentioned in the returns; while <i>Scolopax
rusticula</i> and <i>Regulus cristatus</i> were not at all frequent during
the season under consideration.</p>

<p>Among the rarer or more interesting species observed may be
mentioned <i>Agelæus phœniceus</i>, <i>Ruticilla titys</i>, <i>Procellaria leucorrhoa</i>,
<i>Stercorarius catarrhactes</i>, <i>Anas streperus</i>, and <i>Pandion
haliaëtus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gallinula chloropus</i>, <i>Pica caudata</i>, <i>Gecinus viridis</i>, and <i>Emberiza
miliaria</i> (many of which occurred at the Nash on September
3d) may be mentioned as somewhat unusual migrants.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the writer would suggest to his colleagues the
desirability of making an united report, instead of treating it by
sections. This, it is thought, might readily be done, if the diary
form were adopted, by giving under a common date-heading the
information for the various coasts for that particular day; in
which case the information for the East Coast of Scotland might
lead, followed by the east of England, then the West Coast of
Scotland, the coasts of Ireland, and finally the West Coast of
England. By adopting such a readily feasible plan the significance
and importance of each movement, the area covered by it,
and the species participating in it, would be ascertained at a
glance; while under the present arrangement, to obtain such
very desirable and simple information, reference is necessary to
no less than five separate reports.</p>

<p>The number of stations returning schedules shows a slight
falling off since last year; but this is compensated for by some
light-keepers, who take a greater interest in the subject, sending
three, four, and even five schedules. A column has been added
to the list of lighthouses, showing the number of schedules received
from each station.</p>

<p>Mine Head, Tuskar, Rockabill, and Innishtrahull are foremost
in number; but good schedules have been received from
the Fastnet, Coningbeg, Eagle Island (East), and Blackrock
(Mayo), and a few other localities.</p>

<p>The marked feature of 1886 has been the number of legs and
wings forwarded&mdash;numbering about one hundred&mdash;cut from
birds killed striking the lanterns. In some cases specimens
were received in the flesh; and it is to be hoped that in all
cases of rare birds this will be done in future. Generally
speaking, the legs and wings can be identified with certainty,
and they have been all carefully preserved for reference. Any
doubts which may exist about a species will be removed if the
light-keepers send a leg and wing of every bird killed striking,
with the schedule, in the envelopes provided for this purpose.</p>

<p>The stations sending most specimens were the Tuskar,
Rockabill, and Mine Head; but they were also received from
eleven others. The rarities received were numerous. Mr
Thomas Fortune sent the second Irish specimen of the Wryneck
from Arran Island, N., Co. Galway, killed striking at 2
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on October 6th. The first specimen was shot at Dunmore,
Co. Waterford, October 5th, 1877. From Mr Francis
Ryan, of the Tearaght, Co. Kerry, only four wings and legs
were received; but two of these proved rarities, one belonging
to the Pied Flycatcher, caught at lantern September 21st, and
the other to the Reed Warbler, found dead October 4th. Both
species had only once before been recorded from Ireland.
The Pied Flycatcher occurred at Ballina, Co. Mayo, in April
1875. The Reed Warbler is said to have been shot near
Dublin on December 21st, 1843, but no specimen exists.
Another leg and wing of the Pied Flycatcher, killed striking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">- 120 -</span>
October 5th, was sent by Mr George Dunleavy from the Fastnet,
Co. Cork. From Coningbeg light-ship, Co. Wexford, a leg
and wing of the Reed Warbler was forwarded by Mr Patrick
Cullen and Mr William Clydesdale. It was killed striking
October 4th, the same date as the Tearaght specimen.</p>

<p>These three species&mdash;Wryneck, Pied Flycatcher, and Reed
Warbler&mdash;are examples of birds which breed in Great Britain,
and have only been met with in Ireland during the autumnal
migration, except the Pied Flycatcher, which once occurred in
April. All the birds were observed on the south or west coasts.</p>

<p>Taking the other legs and wings in order. The Missel Thrush
was sent from the Tuskar, being the only specimen yet received.
A male and female Redstart were sent from Rockabill, Co. Dublin,
by Mr Joseph Hammond, having been obtained on April
24th and May 9th respectively. The Redstart has quite recently
been discovered to breed in Ireland, at Powerscourt, Co.
Wicklow. The Black Redstart was received from the Fastnet,
Co. Cork, found dead October 30th. It is recorded at four
other stations on the south coast. Its regular occurrence in
the south and east of Ireland has been established by this inquiry.
On July 10th a "Blackstart" is reported at Rockabill,
Co. Dublin; but no specimen having been sent, this unusual
date requires confirmation. The Whinchat, which is in Ireland
a local bird, was killed striking Coningbeg lantern on May
7th. Several Sedge Warblers and Whitethroats were received
from Rockabill, the Tuskar, and other stations. A rush took
place on May 9th. These Warblers were not previously recognised&mdash;"Tits,"
"Wrens," "Flycatchers," and "Sally-pickers"
doing duty for them, and other allied species. The Grasshopper
Warbler (rare and local in Ireland) was obtained at the
Tuskar, having been correctly identified by Mr Richard Hamilton,
from a copy of Morris' "British Birds" supplied to that
station by the Irish Lights Board. The Blackcap was killed
striking on Eagle Island, off Mayo, as late as October 31st, the
leg, wing, and head being forwarded by Mr Daniel Hawkins.
A fine old male Yellow Wagtail (<i>Motacilla Raii</i>) was killed at
the Tuskar on May 3d. It is rare and local in Ireland, occurring
on the east and south coasts. The wing and leg of a Skylark,
caught striking at Mine Head on 26th February, was of
a much paler colour, and had shorter toes than the ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">- 121 -</span>
form. A very large leg and wing of a Skylark was received
from Arklow South light-ship, killed October 28th. The
October immigration of the Chaffinch was evidenced by the
production of legs and wings, and extended to the lighthouses,
several miles from land, off the west of Ireland. A
Turtle Dove was received from the Tuskar in May, and some
entries of "Doves" in the autumn, which have been placed
under the heading "Pigeons," are perhaps referable to this
species. The repeated occurrence of the Corncrake, several
miles from shore&mdash;killed striking against lanterns between 100
and 200 feet above the sea-level&mdash;must satisfy the sceptical
that this bird can fly long distances and at a high level with great
power and velocity. The Water Rail, which seems so unwilling
to fly, was received from the Fastnet and Tuskar, and the
Water Hen from Rathlin O'Birne, both having been killed striking
on 26th and 28th October. The first two stations are
seven or eight miles from the nearest land, and the last, two
miles. The Water Hen is stated by Mr Macginley of Rathlin
O'Birne to have struck "with tremendous force" at 11.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
This lantern is 116 feet over sea.</p>

<p>The words "Sand Larks," and "Sea Larks," so vague, and
signifying almost any of the smaller Sandpipers, is now better
understood by the production of legs and wings&mdash;those of the
Curlew Sandpiper, Purple Sandpiper, Common Sandpiper, and
Turnstone having been sent. A leg and wing of the Fork-tailed
Petrel was forwarded from Eagle Island, W., off Mayo, caught
at lantern in second week of October.</p>

<p>An egg of this species is recorded to have been found on
the Tearaght, Co. Kerry (<i>Zoologist</i>, 1886, p. 367). Most of
the legs and wings were obtained at the autumnal migration.
The autumn rush of Thrushes, Starlings, Blackbirds, and
Larks took place October 20th to 28th, on the E. and S.E.
coasts, there being little evidence of it on the W. coast.
From 27th February to 1st March another great movement
took place on the S.E. coast, and again about March 27th.
At the N.W. stations a great rush of Fieldfares, Blackbirds,
Thrushes, and Starlings occurred December 17th and 24th,
under the influence of a sudden pinch of cold. The Fieldfares
were noticed in great numbers at Innishtrahull, a rocky islet six
miles north of Donegal. Mr M. S. Kennedy "never saw the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">- 122 -</span>
like." There was snow, with a very strong wind. At Rathlin
O'Birne (West Donegal) immense flocks of birds&mdash;Starlings,
Thrushes, and Fieldfares&mdash;passed west December 18th to 23d.
The nearest land to the west of this rocky island is America,
and one is puzzled to know where the birds were going; but
this is not an isolated occurrence&mdash;the westerly flight of land
birds at stations off the west coast of Ireland has been noticed
on other occasions. The movement is apparently as reckless
as that of the Lemmings. The Ring Ouzel is again stated to
have been seen in the winter (January 15th) at Mine Head.
It is strange that not a single leg and wing of the Grey Linnet,
or the Twite (birds, doubtless, included under the name of
"Linnets"), has yet been received. They seem rarely to strike.
There are two or three instances of the Golden Plover having
been killed striking in 1886. The "Cream-coloured" Gulls
seen off Blackrock, Mayo, November 5th, and also seen in
August 1881, April and May 1882, and October 11th, 1884
(see Report, 1884, p. 181), were probably Iceland Gulls. The
Gannet is well known to every light-keeper, and its movements
are not likely to be confounded with any other bird. The
entries, therefore, under it may be examined with confidence.
Species which are ill-defined, or named with doubtful accuracy
in the Report, are put in in inverted commas. In Ireland
birds are far less numerous than in Great Britain, and
their movements are less distinctly marked. Few entries have,
therefore, been omitted, for their value cannot be estimated
until a number of Reports have been compared. It is proposed
next year to analyse all the Irish observations.</p>

<p>To all the light-keepers forwarding schedules our best thanks
are due; to those sending legs and wings, and specimens in the flesh,
we are under still further obligations. The interest evinced when
three, four, and five schedules are filled with careful notes, shows
the desire to further knowledge for its own sake, and speaks
well for the intelligence of such observers. The Commissioners
of Irish Lights, and their secretary, Mr Owen Armstrong, continue
to give us their very necessary assistance; and Captain
Boxer, E.N., in his frequent visits to the lighthouses, is ever
ready to further the objects of this inquiry.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn an immigration of the Greater Spotted
Woodpecker (<i>Dendrocopus major</i>, Linn.) occurred. It is a very
rare visitor to Ireland, and although not obtained at any light
station the following records may be of interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>November 27th, one at Kilkeel, Co. Down. A second near
Newry, Co. Down, about same date. A third at Glasslough,
Co. Monaghan (see <i>Zoologist</i>, 1887, p. 75). A fourth at Newcastle,
Co. Wicklow, in February 1887. This species is also
recorded from Northumberland on 18th and 20th October.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
